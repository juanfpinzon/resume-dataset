The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.
