{"id": 29, "text": "\"RESUME  WILLIAM P. ALLISON    CAREER SUMMARY  For thirty-two years, Bill Allison has practiced and taught law in Austin, Texas. He began his  career as a lawyer with the Community Legal Services Program, a law office sponsored by The  University Of Texas School Of Law. When the program was absorbed by the Travis County  Legal Aid and Defender Society in 1972, he became a Legal Aid lawyer. In both these positions  he supervised law students in one of the Law Schools earliest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclinical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d programs, what today is  called an externship.  In 1975, Mr. Allison was recruited to be a full time Lecturer at the UT School Of Law, teaching  and supervising students in the newly formed Criminal Defense Clinic (CDC). The CDC was the  Law Schools first true clinic with an academic component. In 1977, Mr. Allison and a student  attorney appealed one of the Clinics early cases, a free speech case, to the United States Supreme  Court and won. Also in 1977, Mr. Allison opened his first private practice in Austin,  concentrating on federal and state criminal defense, while remaining on the faculty half-time as a  Lecturer to continue teaching and supervising CDC students. He began teaching trial advocacy  for the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in 1978 and has taught more than fifty, one- to threeweek trial advocacy courses for lawyers and for law students at various venues around the nation.  In Fall 1995, Mr. Allison was invited to teach a seminar entitled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFranz Kafka and the Systems  of Punishment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Plan II Honors program at UT. He taught that course through the fall  semester of 2002, then turned the course over to the Hon. Robert Pitman, a UT Law School and  CDC graduate, and now a United States Magistrate for the Western District of Texas. Mr. Allison  retired from the la w school faulty after the summer semester, 2002, and has devoted himself to  his private practice. In January 2004, Mr. Allison returned to teaching full time as a Clinical  Professor of Law and Director of the Criminal Defense Clinic.  From 1993 to 1999, Mr. Allison served as Editor-in-Chief of Voice for the Defense, the monthly  magazine of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. He is recognized in The Best  Lawyers in America. In June, 2001, he was named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBest Defense Lawyer of the Year\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for 20002001, by the Criminal Justice Section of the State Bar of Texas. In November 2003, Texas  Monthly Magazine named him one of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuper Lawyers of Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (a peer reviewed award) and  one of the top fifty (50) lawyers for Central and West Texas. He has been listed in Woodward &  Whites Best Lawyers in America since 1996, and has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA/V\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rated by Martindale -Hubble  for over twenty years.  In recent years, Mr. Allison has worked to obtain the exoneration of innocent individuals who  have been wrongfully convic ted, cases of actual innocence. He and a team of lawyers recently  won the release of a young man who had spent more than 12 years in prison for a murder he did  not commit. Mr. Allison also won the exoneration for another innocent man who had spent 16  years in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. Recently, he was part of the team that won  a $5.3 million civil rights settlement for one of these exonerated individuals. He has just  achieved the commutation of a death penalty case in Texas for a mentally retarded man. This was  a court appointed case on which he worked for over six years.  In the Fall of 2003, along with David Sheppard and Prof. Robert Dawson, Mr. Allison  incorporated the Texas Center for Actual Innocence as a Section 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt, non-    1    profit corporation to find and assist actually innocent inmates who are serving long-term or death  penalty sentences. Through the generous cooperation of the UT School Of Law and the Austin  law firm of Graves Daugherty Hearon and Moody, the Center has prepared a syllabus, written a  manual, recruited an initial class of ten students out of fifty applicants, and screened the first  inmate requests. This hybrid class is privately funded, with little or no cost to the law school.  CURRENT  Principal, Law Office of William P. Allison, Austin, Texas.

But one  resume does not fit all. This article  offers tips and suggestions on how to  weave your specialized areas of practice into your resume and make sure  it is tailored to fit your career path.  The American Dietetic Association  offers several resources for those pursuing new employment, including networking opportunities on the local and  national level, ADACareerLink, and  Job Descriptions: Models for Careers in  Dietetics, now in its second edition and  full of job description models for RDs  in clinical, business and consultation,  research, management, and public  health. Also, see \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGetting that First  Job: Search and Resume Tips\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the  September 2006 issue of the Journal  for sample resumes for a first-time job  seeker and an RD with managementlevel experience.

However, the resume is often what gets an applicants  foot in the door.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany people still get caught in the  This article was written by  Jennifer Mathieu, a freelance  writer in Houston, TX. Mathieu is  a former editorial assistant for  the Journal and has journalism  degree from Northwestern  University.

While reporting for the Houston  Press, she received awards from  the Association of Alternative  Newsweeklies, the Dallas Press  Club, the State Bar of Texas, and  the Gay & Lesbian Alliance  Against Defamation.  doi: 10.1016/j.jada.2010.01.004    trap of writing one resume and sending  the same one out to all potential employers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Susan Laramee, MS, RD,  LDN, FADA, manager of clinical recruitment for Sodexo, Inc (Gaithersburg, MD). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany resumes are very generic. If you dont address the skills the  hiring manager is seeking, it is unlikely that you will be invited for an  interview.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Laramee finds the traditional practice of listing an objective to be unnecessary but does believe its important  that credentials and contact information are at the top of the resume and  easy to spot. Because many jobs now  require applicants to apply online,  Laramee says it is key to make sure  your e-mail address is accurate and is  hyperlinked, providing for easy use.  Some of the stronger resumes  Laramee has seen when recruiting for  management positions have been  those that have a bulleted summary  of skills at the top of a resume, for  example, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn-depth comprehension of  principles of nutrition,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDemonstrated capability in customer service,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlexibility to work alone or  as a team member\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (see Figure 1).  BE SPECIFIC  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJob candidates should use strong  verbs like generate, implement, enhance, and improve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Laramee.  In addition to action verbs, specificity  in language is also necessary, especially when tailoring your resume as all  mid-career RD should do, say those interviewed for this article. Mary Jane  Rogalski, MBA, RD, LDN, manager  of clinical nutrition at Baystate  Medical Center in Springfield, MA,  and the chair of the Clinical Nutrition Management dietetic practice  group, looks for details that paint a  clear picture of an RDs previous  employment.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWords like, assessed patient needs  wont do much to describe the type of  patient or the type of facility,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Rogalski. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn a clinical resume, I expect to  see words that describe involvement  with high nutrition risk patients, like    \\xc2\\xa9 2010 by the American Dietetic Association    percentage tube feeding or percentage  total parenteral nutrition. There needs  to be a heavier emphasis on diagnostic  skills\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (see Figure 1). Clinicians in the  inpatient environment should specify  whether they have worked in a trauma  center, teaching hospital, or community hospital as the level of patient nutrition acuity will vary by the type of  institution, says Rogalski. And clinicians in the outpatient environment  would be wise to include specific counseling skills, such as motivational interviewing, when working with clients  outside the hospital environment.  Of course, specificity is not limited to  clinical dietitians resumes. Public health  and community dietitians would want  to provide specific demographics about  the communities they have served  in the past along with measurable  achievements in those communities. A  public health nutritionist would also  want to include his or her knowledge  and experience with population-based  nutrition interventions, community organizing and mobilizing, breastfeeding  education and promotion, and familiarity with government-sponsored programs such as WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,  Infants, and Children). An RD working  in a school environment would need to  list experience and familiarity with federal and state nutrition standards such  as those set by the National School  Lunch Program. School-based dietitians would also need to address potential responsibilities including participating in quality initiatives and  gathering and analyzing data to evaluate and improve outcomes, developing  and coordinating the efforts of the foodservice staff in order to promote nutrition and healthy eating, and analyzing  menus and recipes for nutritional adequacy. An RD working with information technology and developing health  technologies would want to showcase  his or her experience working with  data management systems or knowledge of laws and regulations protecting  health data security and privacy (Figure 2).

Sample resume: Culinary nutrition consultant.    March 2010 \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION    357    BUSINESS OF DIETETICS  RDs applying for positions in consultation and business, such as corporate dietitians, food and nutrition policy consultants (Figure 3), and  culinary nutrition consultants (Figure 4), would also want so show off a  certain set of skills. A corporate dietitian may want to specify media  events in which he or she served as a  corporate spokesperson; a history of  attending trade shows, conferences,  and professional meetings; and brochures, Web sites, and promotional  materials he or she helped create. A  food and nutrition policy consultant  would most likely want to include  years of experience educating and lobbying members of Congress on nutrition topics, familiarity with legislation and regulation that impact the  nutrition industry, and experience  consulting with clients to develop targeted messages and responses to policies and regulations. A culinary nutrition consultant\\xe2\\x80\\x94whose primary  responsibilities might include writing  and editing cookbooks, public speaking,  and offering personal chef services\\xe2\\x80\\x94  would want to provide a publishing and    358    March 2010 Volume 110 Number 3    editing history, locations and class  sizes of nutrition-based cooking classes  and food demonstrations, and an understanding of Joint Commission and  food safety standards.  Laramee also suggests that for midcareer RDs, each previous place of employment include fewer bullets of information, and RDs with many years of  experience can probably omit entry-level  positions or simply list them without providing additional details. While many  RDs with lengthy careers need more  than one page, a resume should never be  more than two pages, Laramee advises.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe resume itself shows your skills  and qualifications in the way its organized and displayed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you  put too much irrelevant information in  your resume, youre showing that you  lack focus or have difficulty with decisions, and your resume will lack clarity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  INCLUDE RELEVANT INFORMATION  As for education and work history,  Laramee advises that RDs include only  relevant material. Information about a  high school diploma and courses taken  in college are generally irrelevant. Be    prepared to briefly and clearly explain  any gaps in work history, and if rereentering the workforce after time off  for family issues, be prepared to discuss  how you have maintained your skills  and kept up to date with new information during that gap.  RDs with extensive careers may  want to skip dates that reveal age,  such as the year a bachelors degree  was earned, says Laramee. Simply  listing the university and degree obtained is sufficient.  While certifications, registrations,  professional involvement, and awards  specific to the field are all important  to include, outside activities or positions outside of dietetics should not  be included unless they can somehow be tailored to fit the position  applied for.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had one applicant who included  information on her first career as a florist because she was able to discuss the  customer service skills she had as a  small business owner,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Rogalski.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose skills could be connected to the  patient service skills she was going to  have to take on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    BUSINESS OF DIETETICS  NAME    Mary Doe, PhD, RD    DEPARTMENT    Medical Affairs    LOCATION    Boston, MA, USA    EDUCATION  2004    PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  2007 to Present    PhD, Nutritional Biochemistry and Human Metabolism  Tufts University Freidman School of Nutrition Science and Policy  Boston, MA, USA  Director, Endocrinology, Metabolic Disease and Cardiology  Acme Research Company    Perform literature searches, write case studies, internal and external education, and support all efforts at bid defense meetings  Heavy involvement with operations groups as well as other business segments  Manage nutrition operations in the endocrinology and cardiology therapeutic area for this fast growing, medically focused and state of the art  global CRO  Responsible for medical/clinical components of the following product/service areas: clinical research and data analysis, study feasibility, study  design and protocol development, reporting and publishing, consulting, and overall service delivery  Serve as lead dietitian and nutritionist for the endocrinology and cardiology therapeutic business unit, and act as major \\xe2\\x80\\x9cout front\\xe2\\x80\\x9d person for the  enterprise  LICENSURE/CERTIFICATION  2001 to Present    PROFESSIONAL MEMBERSHIPS  2000-2007    EDITORIAL BOARDS  2004 to Present    Licensed Dietitian/Nutritionist  Board of Dietitians and Nutritionist  Division of Professional Licensure  Commonwealth of Massachusetts  Boston, MA, USA  Ex-officio Member, General Clinical Research Center  Scientific Advisory Committee  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  Ad hoc reviewer, Obesity Research    BIBLIOGRAPHY  1.

March 2010 \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION    359    BUSINESS OF DIETETICS  THE CV  According to Jeanene Fogli, PhD, RD,  chair of the Research dietetic practice  group, its important to note that the  research and education field may require a different type of resume\\xe2\\x80\\x94a curriculum vitae (known as a CV)\\xe2\\x80\\x94when  applying for jobs. Whether applying to  academic positions or for-profit research positions (such as working for a  pharmaceutical company), interested  applicants will most likely create a CV.  Fogli, a director of medical and scientific affairs for i3 Research (Basking  Ridge, NJ), says a CV will include educational and professional experience,  but unlike a resume will also include a  publishing history and a list of editorial  boards the applicant is a member of  (see Figure 5 for a sample CV).  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA publication history is key,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says  Fogli. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are applying to a for-profit  company, they want to sell your expertise, and a publishing history is part of  that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fogli adds that all applicants for  research positions should include details on any exposure to clinical research and highlight any additional  coursework in the sciences. A strong  research dietitians CV will also specify  experience with regulatory filings for  agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as well as familiarity with  commonly used standardized research  measures such as the National Heart,  Lung, and Blood Institutes iliac waist  measurement. Fogli adds that potential employers are looking for future  employees who will not need to be  trained in specific differences between  a phase I and phase III trial and who  will not need to be educated in the use  of common measurements.  Applicants should also include any  funding they have received, such as  listing a percentage of salary support  for a particular study and identifying  the funder. (For example, a CV may  state 40% salary support for a study on  the effect of jelly beans on the diet with  funding coming from The National  Jelly Bean Board.) According to Fogli,  there is not one set standard for where  in the CV this information should be  included although it should appear  prominently.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are expected to bring in research dollars,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Fogli. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you  have a history of doing that, thats a  bonus, so include it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    360    March 2010 Volume 110 Number 3    ONLINE RESUMES  Many of the popular job and professional networking sites, such as Monster, Hot Jobs, or LinkedIn, as well as  other niche Web sites or services like  ADACareerLink, have you create a  profile where you can upload a resume,  or several, or have you create a resume  using their resume form. Some job sites  let you apply for positions by simply  submitting your profile information. In  these instances, you should edit your  profile so that it specifically reflects the  job for which you are posting. However,  most job sites either provide contact information with an e-mail address  where you should send your resume or  provide a link directly to the employers  Web site where contact information is  provided or you have to fill out an online form.  In these cases, its a good idea to create your resume in several formats: a  print version, a scannable version, and  a plain text version. A print version can  contain italicized or underlined text,  different fonts and sizes, bulleted lists,  and other design elements. This copy  should be used hand to contacts and  interviewers or sent via mail. A scannable version, to send as an e-mail attachment or upload as a file to a Web  site, should contain limited design elements as it is first viewed by a computer and then uploaded to a database  where employers can search resumes  based on keywords. Design elements  and text formatting can interfere with  the scan. For scannable resumes, use  one common font (such as Times New  Roman) throughout (1). Instead of increasing the size of the font, use spacing to break up sections (1). Also, avoid  using bullets, tables, and visuals in a  scannable resume; instead, use dashes,  left-justified text, and simple spacing  (1). A plain text version, or text-only  copy, is a version you should have  available to cut and paste into online  forms or the body of an email. As the  name implies a plain text version contains no design elements.  Whichever format is used, you  want to create a resume specifically  for the job you are applying for.  Also, remember to update all the  versions of your resume; otherwise,  you may update your print version and  accidently send out a scannable version  that wasnt updated.    ADAPT  Fogli adds that positions that include  presenting to clients\\xe2\\x80\\x94research or otherwise\\xe2\\x80\\x94may require the applicant to  supply a video of such a presentation,  so the hiring company can see performance in action.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of the biggest mistakes applicants make is not finding out more  about the position and its requirements  beforehand and not tailoring their resume to the job,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Laramee.  Whether an RDs interest is clinical,  public health, research, or another area  in dietetics, experts agree it is important to have a second or even third  party review the finished resume or CV  for spelling and grammar errors, say  those interviewed for the article. And  above all, be specific in what you create.  Showcasing your specialty areas and  how they apply to the position you are  vying for could mean all the difference  when looking for new opportunities  and expanding your career.  The editors would like to thank Cindy  Krainen, RD, of Harper Associates;  Susan Laramee, MS, RD, LDN, of Sodexo and past ADA President; and Susan Moores, MS, RD, chair of ADAs  Member Value Committee, for their  contributions to this article.
