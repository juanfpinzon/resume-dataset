As a designer she is very detail-oriented and she  can provide constructive and valuable feedback on visual design as well, which is a real plus in our industry.  Dawa can produce very accurate wireframes, white board exercises and give advice on the final output. Her  strengths are definitely precision, attention to details, passion for the product and managerial skills.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Fabio Benedetti, worked directly with Dawa at Alfresco  \"\"Dawa was a member of our sprint team and she made invaluable contributions to the UX design of our  current and future android products. She understands the requirements and bought unique views that can be  implemented.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Surendra Devarashetty, worked directly with Dawa at Intel Corporation  \"\"Dawa was a great addition to our Ux team. She could always be counted on to bring a fresh perspective  to our projects and follow through with reliability. Dawa\\'s experience and talents made her a natural fit for  mobile Ux design. She will be missed.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jim Granger, managed Dawa at Intel Corporation  \"\"I had the esteemed privilege to work with Dawa on a complicated workflow web app for our company  CrossCurrent. Being a primary developer on the project it was an absolute dream to have a designer as  thoughtful, talented and easy to work with as Dawa. The design principles she came up with were thorough  and her wireframes were impeccably presented. What I appreciated about Dawa was that she was very  approachable and some of my best and easiest work was developing side by side with her giving tips and    Page7    recommendations as I went. I believe that the strength of our product was much improved by her work, and  would gladly recommend her to anyone seeking a highly qualified, professional UI/UX designer.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jesse Stromwick, worked directly with Dawa at CrossCurrent, Inc.  \"\"Dawa is a highly competent user experience designer with strong expertise in mobile and responsive design.  She brought valuable insight to the SapientNitro UX team at Vodafone UK where she worked on the mobile  \\'Help & Support\\' section of the website. Her attention to detail together with her technical understanding  helped to deliver a useful, usable and well-considered solution. I recommend her without hesitation!\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Dominic Winsor, managed Dawa indirectly at Vodafone - Sapient Nitro  \"\"Dawa and I worked together on a web user survey study for MTV\\'s video on demand service. Dawa was  responsible for designing the survey, collecting the data, carrying out statistical analysis on the user data  and creating detailed finding reports. Furthermore, she expertly led an in-lab usability study on the client\\'s  prototype, and a diary study/focus group with the target audience. Dawa provided the client with phenomenal  insights and displayed excellent presentation skills in her delivery of her findings to MTV and was an asset to  the team and I would not hesitate to work with her again.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cam Bennett, worked directly with Dawa at Cimex Media Ltd  \"\"I worked alongside Dawa at Skype. She was the UX resource on the re-design for Skype.com (Skype\\'s  consumer facing website). Dawa contributed intelligent UX solutions and delivered high fidelity wireframes  of her ideas.

I  look forward to working with her again in the future and would recommend her in a heartbeat.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Alex Rekasi, worked directly with Dawa at Skype  \"\"I had a great experience managing Dawa during the length of her contract at Adobe. Her ramp up time was  minimal and her impact immediate. She provided us with smart design that met both user needs and was  implementable within our schedule. If you are looking for a competent designer who knows their craft and  can deliver - you\\'ll be well served speaking with Dawa.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Dan Cooney, was Dawa\\'s client  \"\"Dawa was a real joy to work, both as a Sr Information Architect and Interaction Architect on a large number  of complex engagements. She brought deep and broad senior-level UX skillsets to each project, as well as an  intimate knowledge as to the technical feasibility of what was being designed due to her hardcore background  as a developer, too. We worked together on projects that spanned extremely creative/edgy/marketing-focused  to complex, interaction-based web-based apps for the general public (the largest credit card company in the  world). She was pivotal in spear-heading a complete re-design of an extremely complex, internal-facing, webbased app for insurance and annuities groups of a Fortune 100 client, including extensive field user research  Page8    of financial advisers/brokers as insights into the new user-centric design that we proposed and built. I would  welcome the opportunity to work with Dawa on any type of project in the future and hope that our paths cross  again.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Steve Haak, managed Dawa at Avenue A Razorfish  \"\"I was working with Dawa on a six month project for Prudential Retirement to design the user experience  strategy for a splan administrator website. Dawa picked up on the financial information for retirement plans  right away, and took a leading role in designing the interactions and data displays for one of the major site  sections. Dawa completed most of her work independently without the need for much guidance. She could  always be relied on to have her work completed on time, and with the extra thought put in to deliver more  than what was asked for. Dawa\\'s work was well received all around, and I can only recommend her for any  future projects.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Martin Kas, managed Dawa at Avenue A Razorfish  \"\"My first impression of Dawa was of our portfolio review when she came in to interview. With no trace of  hesitation, she showed both her finished work alongside several hand-drawn wireframes and prints which she  had annotated by hand. I could quickly tell that she would be able to create a finished product, but was also  able to cogently discuss her thoughts using whatever medium was around. In other words, she is a designer  who can quickly make her point.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Erik Gibb, managed Dawa indirectly at Modem Media/Digitas Inc./Publicis  \"\"Dawa was the UI/UX lead developer and designer at SDO. As such, she pioneered CMS software for  WNYC and other major clients built on open source technology, creating first of its kind software interfaces  as well as compelling web user experiences. In addition, she was the news anchor at Talk Tech: an  innovative, syndicated radio program where her passion and knowledge for technology showed through  and gave communities access to knowledge of emerging technologies. I recommend her highly to any team  requiring highly developed skills in both the technical and creative arenas, and in need of an individual with  the passion and drive to make it happen.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Colleen Nagle, managed Dawa at SDO.Net and TalkTech  Contact Dawa on LinkedIn    Page9\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1, 11, "Name"], [13, 28, "Designation"], [111, 145, "Degree"], [149, 169, "College Name"], [181, 201, "Years of Experience"], [246, 264, "Companies worked at"], [269, 288, "Companies worked at"], [298, 304, "Location"], [306, 314, "Location"], [319, 332, "Location"], [390, 396, "Companies worked at"], [399, 408, "Companies worked at"], [410, 415, "Companies worked at"], [417, 422, "Companies worked at"], [424, 432, "Companies worked at"], [437, 442, "Companies worked at"], [1043, 1058, "Designation"], [1062, 1071, "Companies worked at"], [1072, 1101, "Years of Experience"], [1121, 1135, "Designation"], [1275, 1289, "Designation"], [1443, 1456, "Designation"], [1460, 1481, "Companies worked at"], [1485, 1503, "Companies worked at"], [1505, 1534, "Years of Experience"], [1620, 1628, "Companies worked at"], [2234, 2252, "Designation"], [2256, 2262, "Companies worked at"], [2273, 2300, "Years of Experience"], [2686, 2702, "Designation"], [2706, 2714, "Companies worked at"], [2716, 2740, "Years of Experience"], [3404, 3422, "Designation"], [3426, 3443, "Companies worked at"], [3445, 3470, "Years of Experience"], [3669, 3693, "Designation"], [3697, 3706, "Companies worked at"], [3708, 3731, "Years of Experience"], [4055, 4059, "Companies worked at"], [4061, 4070, "Companies worked at"], [4072, 4080, "Companies worked at"], [4085, 4106, "Companies worked at"], [4109, 4136, "Designation"], [4140, 4158, "Companies worked at"], [4160, 4189, "Years of Experience"], [4252, 4260, "Location"], [4707, 4729, "Designation"], [4733, 4737, "Companies worked at"], [4739, 4761, "Years of Experience"], [4853, 4855, "Location"], [5310, 5314, "Companies worked at"], [5317, 5333, "Designation"], [5336, 5344, "Companies worked at"], [5347, 5360, "Companies worked at"], [5362, 5387, "Years of Experience"], [5459, 5461, "Location"], [5476, 5484, "Companies worked at"], [5638, 5663, "Designation"], [5667, 5682, "Companies worked at"], [5684, 5714, "Years of Experience"], [6208, 6232, "Designation"], [6236, 6246, "Companies worked at"], [6248, 6273, "Years of Experience"], [6721, 6745, "Designation"], [6749, 6754, "Companies worked at"], [6756, 6781, "Years of Experience"], [7069, 7084, "Designation"], [7088, 7097, "Companies worked at"], [7099, 7129, "Years of Experience"], [7546, 7569, "Designation"], [7573, 7578, "Companies worked at"], [7580, 7604, "Years of Experience"], [8081, 8106, "Designation"], [8110, 8119, "Companies worked at"], [8121, 8132, "Years of Experience"], [8594, 8615, "Designation"], [8619, 8637, "Companies worked at"], [8639, 8650, "Years of Experience"], [9263, 9284, "Designation"], [9288, 9312, "Companies worked at"], [9332, 9343, "Years of Experience"], [9685, 9706, "Designation"], [9710, 9718, "Companies worked at"], [9720, 9731, "Years of Experience"], [10201, 10221, "Designation"], [10225, 10236, "Companies worked at"], [10238, 10249, "Years of Experience"], [10620, 10651, "Designation"], [10655, 10659, "Companies worked at"], [10661, 10672, "Years of Experience"], [10806, 10828, "Designation"], [10832, 10839, "Companies worked at"], [10844, 10852, "Companies worked at"], [10854, 10865, "Years of Experience"], [11817, 11837, "College Name"], [11839, 11871, "Degree"], [11899, 11909, "Degree"], [11922, 11932, "Name"], [11934, 11949, "Designation"], [11971, 11989, "Email Address"], [1103, 1118, "Years of Experience"], [1536, 1544, "Years of Experience"], [2302, 2310, "Years of Experience"], [2677, 2683, "Companies worked at"], [2741, 2750, "Years of Experience"], [3472, 3480, "Years of Experience"], [3733, 3741, "Years of Experience"], [3744, 3753, "Job Specific Skills"], [4190, 4199, "Years of Experience"], [4202, 4211, "Job Specific Skills"], [4602, 4628, "Tech Tools"], [4651, 4664, "Job Specific Skills"], [4763, 4771, "Years of Experience"], [5389, 5397, "Years of Experience"], [5716, 5724, "Years of Experience"], [6275, 6283, "Years of Experience"], [6783, 6791, "Years of Experience"], [6808, 6826, "Job Specific Skills"], [6831, 6833, "Job Specific Skills"], [7131, 7139, "Years of Experience"], [7234, 7251, "Job Specific Skills"], [7253, 7261, "Job Specific Skills"], [7263, 7276, "Job Specific Skills"], [7606, 7614, "Years of Experience"], [8134, 8150, "Years of Experience"], [8652, 8659, "Years of Experience"]]}
