William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2006-2007)  Summary of Research and Scholarship:  I am a sociologist of higher education. Through research, writing, and teaching, I have contributed to our  understanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher  education. My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas\\xe2\\x80\\x94what facilitates it and  what impedes it within different types of colleges and universities\\xe2\\x80\\x94and identifies implications for academic  leaders who manage organizational change, knowledge change and professional socialization. Using theories  and methods from sociology, I analyze how organizational, intellectual, political, economic, and professional  interests redefine the content, structure, conduct, and relative legitimacy of academic fields.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Key studies include: the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields; dynamics of  professional socialization across disciplines; tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective  investment; the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education (1975-2000), a pivotal era of  changing societal expectations; forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration.  Serving in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry in  graduate education, leadership development, academic collaboration, and organizational change.  2    PUBLICATIONS  Books  Gumport, P.

Current Research:  American Government: Democracy in Transition (Pearson, under contract)  This book examines the American political system and its institutions as we transform from a  democracy of self-interest to one of increasing transparency and evidence-based decision  making. The book is designed for introductory American Government courses, and therefore  covers, in depth, the framers, constitutional theory, institutions, and participation  while  simultaneously engaging with a student population who may be only vaguely interested in  government.  Linking Science to Decision Making in Environmental Policy: Bridging the Disciplinary Gap (coauthored with Lawrence Becker, The MIT Press, under contract)  This book examines the role of science in moderating interest-based politics in resource  management and environmental stewardship. The manuscript builds a model of science based  policy processes where management decisions are based on stakeholder input but constrained  by scientific efficacy. Ultimately, the project is intended to develop a protocol to maximize crossdisciplinary decision making in environmental policy.  Environmental Deceptions: The Tension between Liberalism and Environmental Policymaking in  the United States (with Kristy Michaud; Albany: State University of New York Press, 2nd edition  under contract)  This book brings together normative analyses and empirical data to explain the structural  limitations liberal society places on environmental improvement. I argue that cultural  ambivalence toward communitarian ethics has made the traditional environmental  infrastructure problematic. The book exposes the subtle tensions that often lead to policy  failure, and suggests that traditional policy models are insufficient to resolve existing  environmental dilemmas in air, water, waste, and energy.

This was a research  project that studied the properties of preempt_rt patched Linux in real world scenarios and  decided on worst case timings that will satisfy requirements in ABBs robotic applications    Project  Name  Role  Client  Duration  Work Location  Description    Description  CCPU  Software Developer  NOATM  July 2009  Bangalore  This project involved putting realtime embedded Linux on the MPC5200 based CCPU board.

Such porting does not provide any value  addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.

Jensen Project Justification    Page 2 of 2    Looking at Bradleys achievements, its hard to believe his phone wasnt ringing off the  hook. But his original r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 was a five-page data dump that made the reader really  work to figure how what hed done.  Part of his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was that he was good at just about every aspect of senior  management, so defining a brand and honing in on the most relevant achievements was  a challenge. I embraced his multiple talents as assets and positioned him a leader who  delivers bottom-line growth by improving every aspect of business from Sales to  Operations to HR. I built a branding statement and brief introductory profile to set the  expectations of the reader accordingly.    Rather than trying to include all of his accomplishments, I honed in on representative  projects from each of his areas of strength, creating mini case studies that provide insight  into Bradleys management style and proof of his effectiveness. One of his  accomplishments, saving $30M per year in delivery model operations, became a simple  graph that tells an immediate story to the reader.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\n.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\n\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\n\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\n\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBirla Institute Of Technology -  Pilani, Rajasthan\n\n2011\n\nBachelor of Technology in Computer Science\n\nUniversity College Of Engineering, University Of Kerala\n\n2005 to 2009\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET:\n\n\n\nLanguages: Core Java\nFront end/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[4543, 4576, "College Name"], [4499, 4541, "Degree"], [4493, 4498, "Graduation Year"], [4441, 4471, "College Name"], [4410, 4428, "Companies worked at"], [2654, 2672, "Companies worked at"], [2632, 2652, "Designation"], [1260, 1278, "Companies worked at"], [1238, 1258, "Designation"], [487, 505, "Companies worked at"], [465, 485, "Designation"], [97, 144, "Email Address"], [16, 36, "Designation"], [0, 15, "Name"], [39, 51, "Companies worked at"], [53, 75, "Location"], [160, 167, "Years of Experience"], [509, 529, "Years of Experience"], [603, 627, "Companies worked at"], [1282, 1302, "Location"], [1306, 1327, "Years of Experience"], [2676, 2696, "Location"], [2700, 2727, "Years of Experience"], [4474, 4491, "Location"], [4578, 4598, "College Name"], [4600, 4612, "Graduation Year"], [273, 299, "Job Specific Skills"], [531, 566, "Companies worked at"], [809, 840, "Companies worked at"], [949, 965, "Soft Skills"], [933, 947, "Soft Skills"], [1148, 1157, "Companies worked at"], [1178, 1189, "Job Specific Skills"], [1191, 1198, "Job Specific Skills"], [1203, 1210, "Job Specific Skills"], [1227, 1231, "Tech Tools"], [1233, 1236, "Tech Tools"], [1431, 1454, "Tech Tools"], [1519, 1529, "Tech Tools"], [2340, 2351, "Job Specific Skills"], [2353, 2360, "Job Specific Skills"], [2365, 2372, "Job Specific Skills"], [2389, 2393, "Tech Tools"], [2395, 2405, "Tech Tools"], [2618, 2625, "Tech Tools"], [2627, 2630, "Tech Tools"], [3986, 3997, "Job Specific Skills"], [3999, 4006, "Job Specific Skills"], [4011, 4018, "Job Specific Skills"], [4035, 4044, "Tech Tools"], [4301, 4305, "Tech Tools"], [4341, 4346, "Tech Tools"], [4663, 4672, "Tech Tools"], [4706, 4716, "Tech Tools"], [4718, 4721, "Tech Tools"], [4732, 4742, "Tech Tools"], [4748, 4755, "Tech Tools"], [4757, 4768, "Tech Tools"], [4781, 4787, "Tech Tools"], [4797, 4800, "Tech Tools"], [4830, 4837, "Tech Tools"], [4839, 4844, "Tech Tools"], [4846, 4850, "Tech Tools"], [389, 409, "Job Specific Skills"], [422, 445, "Job Specific Skills"], [1832, 1851, "Job Specific Skills"], [4673, 4686, "Job Specific Skills"], [4693, 4704, "Job Specific Skills"], [4722, 4730, "Job Specific Skills"]]}

Brief Work History    My involvement in the fields of SPED and REHAB extends back to the early 1970\\'s.  While an undergraduate student, I was employed as a drug rehabilitation and crisis intervention  counselor and I volunteered as a cub-scout master for a troop that integrated youth with  disabilities into the general troop. My work while achieving my M.Ed. and Ed.S., involved the  development and delivery of habilitation and educational services to person with developmental  disabilities. During that period I was a teacher, a director of a community educational program,  and performed research and demonstration activities at Kent State University. While in  Kentucky, I worked towards developing integrated and \"\"state of the art\"\" educational and  rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities. Further, I spent two years attempting to assist  persons with disabilities accessing appropriate employment outcomes. Upon returning to Ohio, I  worked with adults that had a college education, to access meaningful and appropriate  employment. In my role as Associate Director and Assistant Professor, my efforts focused on  systematically address education, employment, and transitional issues for persons with the full  range of disabilities. With my return to Kentucky as an Associate Professor of Special  Education, my focus has continued be on transition and employment issues for youth and adults  with disabilities. I have participated in a wide range of transition programs that include  consulting on two educational systems change grants (Kentuckys Transition Systems Change  Project and Kentuckys Severe Systems Change Project). Further, in Kentucky, I have directed  numerous state and federally funded demonstration and research grants in transition and  employment. I consult with the Kentucky Board of Education and the Kentucky Association of  School Boards on a variety of education issues. Until the summer of 2002 I was coordinator of  Kentuckys State Improvement Grant in Special Education (a federal grant designed to improve  special education services throughout the state). Since then, I have directed the special education  and distance education programs in special education, overseen numerous grants and projects,  and taught coursework in special education.

Enhanced a set of web services providing a proprietary back end for AMI\\'s in-progress content  management system. The system is written in Scala and needed a set of extensions for both the  ingestion and retrieval systems.        Designed an improvement to AMI\\'s proprietary search engine to prevent it from returning links to  properties that were not available to the user performing the search.        Wrote functional tests in Python using AMI\\'s proprietary connection library.    HELIOS    &    MATHESON,    MPHASIS, New York, NY (subsidiary of HEWLETT PACKARD)    New    York,    NY  2014    Ontologist      This was a 3-month contract with MphasiS. Helios & Matheson was the W-2 employer but had no  influence over the work.        Designed an ontology representing a catalog for electrical products as a proof of concept. The  ultimate client was Schneider Electric, a multinational company, on behalf of their Australian  subsidiary Clipsal.        Wrote SPARQL queries used by a generic Web application so that new product hierarchies, userspecific displays of details, and user-defined ideas of product similarity could be added to the  application solely by changing the ontology, with no programming modifications.    LEXISNEXIS, New York, NY    2010  2014    Senior Content Architect / Ontologist      Designed a schema in RELAX NG and XML Schema for government agency documents.        Designed and documented modular entity schemas that specify the standard LexisNexis  representations of information about judges, legislatures, expert witnesses, and commercial  organizations. These schemas were delivered in three variants: for editorial use, for the master  repository, and for the internal document bus. Reviewed and updated modules written by other team  members, and led the reviews of my own modules.        Enhanced a widely used schema module for legal citations to handle cases where text explaining the  purpose of the citation appears in separate sections of a document).        Wrote and supported several internal tools for crude XML analysis, generating \"\"version 0\"\" schemas  reflecting what is actually present in large samples of existing documents (up to a million documents  per run).        Rewrote the internal schema used by the content team to document our schemas.        Led the development team for the Lexis Content Ontology, a high-visibility, high-pressure, loosely  specified project with a hard deadline for its first version. Learned essentially from scratch the  principles of ontology design, how to convert logical data models from PowerDesigner, and the  Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 OWL editor.        Delivered six major sub-ontologies based on the entity schema modules and data models,  contributed to all other sub-ontologies, and reviewed all team results, making possible the on-time  delivery of the ontology.        Developed a strategy for migrating all schema development source control from the LexisNexis  legacy system (IBM ClearCase) to Subversion. Identified platform requirements, wrote installation  and migration plans, and communicated strategy to the architecture team. Supported the migration  effort by assisting the other team members with conversion to the new style. The new system has  been essentially problem-free for over a year. Another LexisNexis team has converted to Subversion  following the plans I wrote.        Updated the schemas and conversion instructions for business directories and news items to handle  non-U.S. sources.        Implemented a continuous-build server for schemas analogous to those used for code.    2007  2010    GOOGLE, New York, NY  Developer Advocate (Internal) (2009  2010)      Led Google Data API orientation, design review, code review, pre-launch, and new technology  evangelism meetings, as well as answering one-off questions, for about 25 Google service teams,  including Google Book Search, Calendar, Contacts, Spreadsheets, and Webmaster Tools.        Wrote and maintained a variety of checklists so that others could lead these meetings in future.        Wrote code and configuration files for a sample Google Data API to be used by Google engineers to  help them develop their own APIs.        Wrote internal programmer documentation, including feature design documents and HOWTOs, on  issues like specifying postal addresses and handling unauthorized requests among others.        Maintained the extensive (25-page) internal Google Data API FAQ.        Wrote extensive and detailed reviews of many internal proposals.        Interviewed 35 candidates for software engineering jobs at Google.    Senior Programmer Analyst (2007  2009)      Designed a backward-compatible standard format for all the errors reported by the Google Data API  engine and the various services that expose GData feeds, and provided a central internal registry of  those errors.        Made extensive modifications to the internal Google Data APIs engine to bring it into full compliance  with HTTP, specifically to support standard concurrency control. These changes have now been  rolled out to essentially all Google Data APIs.        Wrote    Google\\'s    XML    Document    Format    Style    Guide,    published    at    http://google-    styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xmlstyle.html.
