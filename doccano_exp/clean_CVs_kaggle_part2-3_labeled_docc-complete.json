{"id": 29, "text": "\"RESUME  WILLIAM P. ALLISON    CAREER SUMMARY  For thirty-two years, Bill Allison has practiced and taught law in Austin, Texas. He began his  career as a lawyer with the Community Legal Services Program, a law office sponsored by The  University Of Texas School Of Law. When the program was absorbed by the Travis County  Legal Aid and Defender Society in 1972, he became a Legal Aid lawyer. In both these positions  he supervised law students in one of the Law Schools earliest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclinical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d programs, what today is  called an externship.  In 1975, Mr. Allison was recruited to be a full time Lecturer at the UT School Of Law, teaching  and supervising students in the newly formed Criminal Defense Clinic (CDC). The CDC was the  Law Schools first true clinic with an academic component. In 1977, Mr. Allison and a student  attorney appealed one of the Clinics early cases, a free speech case, to the United States Supreme  Court and won. Also in 1977, Mr. Allison opened his first private practice in Austin,  concentrating on federal and state criminal defense, while remaining on the faculty half-time as a  Lecturer to continue teaching and supervising CDC students. He began teaching trial advocacy  for the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in 1978 and has taught more than fifty, one- to threeweek trial advocacy courses for lawyers and for law students at various venues around the nation.  In Fall 1995, Mr. Allison was invited to teach a seminar entitled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFranz Kafka and the Systems  of Punishment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Plan II Honors program at UT. He taught that course through the fall  semester of 2002, then turned the course over to the Hon. Robert Pitman, a UT Law School and  CDC graduate, and now a United States Magistrate for the Western District of Texas. Mr. Allison  retired from the la w school faulty after the summer semester, 2002, and has devoted himself to  his private practice. In January 2004, Mr. Allison returned to teaching full time as a Clinical  Professor of Law and Director of the Criminal Defense Clinic.  From 1993 to 1999, Mr. Allison served as Editor-in-Chief of Voice for the Defense, the monthly  magazine of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. He is recognized in The Best  Lawyers in America. In June, 2001, he was named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBest Defense Lawyer of the Year\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for 20002001, by the Criminal Justice Section of the State Bar of Texas. In November 2003, Texas  Monthly Magazine named him one of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuper Lawyers of Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (a peer reviewed award) and  one of the top fifty (50) lawyers for Central and West Texas. He has been listed in Woodward &  Whites Best Lawyers in America since 1996, and has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA/V\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rated by Martindale -Hubble  for over twenty years.  In recent years, Mr. Allison has worked to obtain the exoneration of innocent individuals who  have been wrongfully convic ted, cases of actual innocence. He and a team of lawyers recently  won the release of a young man who had spent more than 12 years in prison for a murder he did  not commit. Mr. Allison also won the exoneration for another innocent man who had spent 16  years in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. Recently, he was part of the team that won  a $5.3 million civil rights settlement for one of these exonerated individuals. He has just  achieved the commutation of a death penalty case in Texas for a mentally retarded man. This was  a court appointed case on which he worked for over six years.  In the Fall of 2003, along with David Sheppard and Prof. Robert Dawson, Mr. Allison  incorporated the Texas Center for Actual Innocence as a Section 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt, non-    1    profit corporation to find and assist actually innocent inmates who are serving long-term or death  penalty sentences. Through the generous cooperation of the UT School Of Law and the Austin  law firm of Graves Daugherty Hearon and Moody, the Center has prepared a syllabus, written a  manual, recruited an initial class of ten students out of fifty applicants, and screened the first  inmate requests. This hybrid class is privately funded, with little or no cost to the law school.  CURRENT  Principal, Law Office of William P. Allison, Austin, Texas.
