Dawa provided the client with phenomenal  insights and displayed excellent presentation skills in her delivery of her findings to MTV and was an asset to  the team and I would not hesitate to work with her again.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cam Bennett, worked directly with Dawa at Cimex Media Ltd  \"\"I worked alongside Dawa at Skype. She was the UX resource on the re-design for Skype.com (Skype\\'s  consumer facing website). Dawa contributed intelligent UX solutions and delivered high fidelity wireframes  of her ideas. She is a great resource to have on any team, easy to collaborate with and is design / UX savvy. I  look forward to working with her again in the future and would recommend her in a heartbeat.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Alex Rekasi, worked directly with Dawa at Skype  \"\"I had a great experience managing Dawa during the length of her contract at Adobe. Her ramp up time was  minimal and her impact immediate. She provided us with smart design that met both user needs and was  implementable within our schedule. If you are looking for a competent designer who knows their craft and  can deliver - you\\'ll be well served speaking with Dawa.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Dan Cooney, was Dawa\\'s client  \"\"Dawa was a real joy to work, both as a Sr Information Architect and Interaction Architect on a large number  of complex engagements. She brought deep and broad senior-level UX skillsets to each project, as well as an  intimate knowledge as to the technical feasibility of what was being designed due to her hardcore background  as a developer, too. We worked together on projects that spanned extremely creative/edgy/marketing-focused  to complex, interaction-based web-based apps for the general public (the largest credit card company in the  world). She was pivotal in spear-heading a complete re-design of an extremely complex, internal-facing, webbased app for insurance and annuities groups of a Fortune 100 client, including extensive field user research  Page8    of financial advisers/brokers as insights into the new user-centric design that we proposed and built. I would  welcome the opportunity to work with Dawa on any type of project in the future and hope that our paths cross  again.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Steve Haak, managed Dawa at Avenue A Razorfish  \"\"I was working with Dawa on a six month project for Prudential Retirement to design the user experience  strategy for a splan administrator website. Dawa picked up on the financial information for retirement plans  right away, and took a leading role in designing the interactions and data displays for one of the major site  sections. Dawa completed most of her work independently without the need for much guidance. She could  always be relied on to have her work completed on time, and with the extra thought put in to deliver more  than what was asked for. Dawa\\'s work was well received all around, and I can only recommend her for any  future projects.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Martin Kas, managed Dawa at Avenue A Razorfish  \"\"My first impression of Dawa was of our portfolio review when she came in to interview. With no trace of  hesitation, she showed both her finished work alongside several hand-drawn wireframes and prints which she  had annotated by hand. I could quickly tell that she would be able to create a finished product, but was also  able to cogently discuss her thoughts using whatever medium was around. In other words, she is a designer  who can quickly make her point.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Erik Gibb, managed Dawa indirectly at Modem Media/Digitas Inc./Publicis  \"\"Dawa was the UI/UX lead developer and designer at SDO. As such, she pioneered CMS software for  WNYC and other major clients built on open source technology, creating first of its kind software interfaces  as well as compelling web user experiences. In addition, she was the news anchor at Talk Tech: an  innovative, syndicated radio program where her passion and knowledge for technology showed through  and gave communities access to knowledge of emerging technologies. I recommend her highly to any team  requiring highly developed skills in both the technical and creative arenas, and in need of an individual with  the passion and drive to make it happen.\"\"

Jensen Project Justification    Page 2 of 2    Looking at Bradleys achievements, its hard to believe his phone wasnt ringing off the  hook. But his original r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 was a five-page data dump that made the reader really  work to figure how what hed done.  Part of his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was that he was good at just about every aspect of senior  management, so defining a brand and honing in on the most relevant achievements was  a challenge. I embraced his multiple talents as assets and positioned him a leader who  delivers bottom-line growth by improving every aspect of business from Sales to  Operations to HR. I built a branding statement and brief introductory profile to set the  expectations of the reader accordingly.    Rather than trying to include all of his accomplishments, I honed in on representative  projects from each of his areas of strength, creating mini case studies that provide insight  into Bradleys management style and proof of his effectiveness. One of his  accomplishments, saving $30M per year in delivery model operations, became a simple  graph that tells an immediate story to the reader.  I wanted to take advantage of Bradleys stellar early career performance as an executive  at a major bank without risking age discrimination. So I created an Early Career  Summary without dates.  Bradleys new resume generated a lot of interest. He landed a General Manager position  within three months at a premier HR services firm.\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[42, 59, "Name"], [63, 75, "Location"], [106, 123, "Email Address"], [127, 143, "Designation"], [153, 184, "Designation"], [353, 376, "Years of Experience"], [408, 415, "Skills"], [608, 629, "Skills"], [631, 638, "Skills"], [644, 673, "Skills"], [706, 744, "Skills"], [752, 782, "Skills"], [786, 806, "Skills"], [814, 830, "Skills"], [831, 852, "Skills"], [860, 879, "Skills"], [883, 890, "Skills"], [892, 920, "Skills"], [925, 944, "Skills"], [946, 980, "Skills"], [983, 998, "Skills"], [1002, 1011, "Skills"], [1041, 1059, "Companies worked at"], [1061, 1073, "Location"], [1074, 1086, "Years of Experience"], [1165, 1169, "Location"], [1175, 1179, "Location"], [1226, 1262, "Designation"], [1401, 1405, "Location"], [1410, 1415, "Location"], [1518, 1535, "Name"], [1583, 1601, "Email Address"], [1905, 1919, "Skills"], [1882, 1903, "Skills"], [2515, 2535, "Skills"], [2762, 2778, "Location"], [2889, 2907, "Companies worked at"], [2922, 2947, "Designation"], [3128, 3140, "Years of Experience"], [3348, 3379, "Companies worked at"], [3381, 3393, "Location"], [3508, 3547, "Designation"], [3548, 3562, "Years of Experience"], [3825, 3847, "Skills"], [4352, 4368, "Skills"], [4540, 4595, "Designation"], [4596, 4611, "Years of Experience"], [4696, 4726, "Designation"], [4728, 4746, "Location"], [4747, 4762, "Years of Experience"], [4766, 4778, "Years of Experience"], [4782, 4799, "Name"], [4847, 4865, "Email Address"], [4967, 4983, "Skills"], [4985, 5003, "Skills"], [5017, 5039, "Skills"], [5044, 5102, "Designation"], [5103, 5118, "Years of Experience"], [5290, 5300, "Designation"], [5302, 5320, "Designation"], [5327, 5337, "Designation"], [5349, 5372, "Designation"], [5377, 5386, "Companies worked at"], [5387, 5414, "Location"], [5651, 5654, "Degree"], [5656, 5677, "Degree"], [5679, 5700, "College Name"], [5702, 5706, "Graduation Year"], [5708, 5731, "Degree"], [5733, 5754, "College Name"], [5756, 5760, "Graduation Year"], [5764, 5781, "Name"], [6390, 6395, "Designation"], [6400, 6410, "Designation"], [6414, 6416, "Designation"], [7183, 7198, "Designation"]]}

Wrote functional tests in Python using AMI\\'s proprietary connection library.    HELIOS    &    MATHESON,    MPHASIS, New York, NY (subsidiary of HEWLETT PACKARD)    New    York,    NY  2014    Ontologist      This was a 3-month contract with MphasiS. Helios & Matheson was the W-2 employer but had no  influence over the work.        Designed an ontology representing a catalog for electrical products as a proof of concept. The  ultimate client was Schneider Electric, a multinational company, on behalf of their Australian  subsidiary Clipsal.        Wrote SPARQL queries used by a generic Web application so that new product hierarchies, userspecific displays of details, and user-defined ideas of product similarity could be added to the  application solely by changing the ontology, with no programming modifications.    LEXISNEXIS, New York, NY    2010  2014    Senior Content Architect / Ontologist      Designed a schema in RELAX NG and XML Schema for government agency documents.        Designed and documented modular entity schemas that specify the standard LexisNexis  representations of information about judges, legislatures, expert witnesses, and commercial  organizations. These schemas were delivered in three variants: for editorial use, for the master  repository, and for the internal document bus. Reviewed and updated modules written by other team  members, and led the reviews of my own modules.        Enhanced a widely used schema module for legal citations to handle cases where text explaining the  purpose of the citation appears in separate sections of a document).        Wrote and supported several internal tools for crude XML analysis, generating \"\"version 0\"\" schemas  reflecting what is actually present in large samples of existing documents (up to a million documents  per run).        Rewrote the internal schema used by the content team to document our schemas.        Led the development team for the Lexis Content Ontology, a high-visibility, high-pressure, loosely  specified project with a hard deadline for its first version. Learned essentially from scratch the  principles of ontology design, how to convert logical data models from PowerDesigner, and the  Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 OWL editor.        Delivered six major sub-ontologies based on the entity schema modules and data models,  contributed to all other sub-ontologies, and reviewed all team results, making possible the on-time  delivery of the ontology.        Developed a strategy for migrating all schema development source control from the LexisNexis  legacy system (IBM ClearCase) to Subversion. Identified platform requirements, wrote installation  and migration plans, and communicated strategy to the architecture team. Supported the migration  effort by assisting the other team members with conversion to the new style. The new system has  been essentially problem-free for over a year. Another LexisNexis team has converted to Subversion  following the plans I wrote.        Updated the schemas and conversion instructions for business directories and news items to handle  non-U.S. sources.        Implemented a continuous-build server for schemas analogous to those used for code.    2007  2010    GOOGLE, New York, NY  Developer Advocate (Internal) (2009  2010)      Led Google Data API orientation, design review, code review, pre-launch, and new technology  evangelism meetings, as well as answering one-off questions, for about 25 Google service teams,  including Google Book Search, Calendar, Contacts, Spreadsheets, and Webmaster Tools.

Also much time was required to port ABB  applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on  single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux  while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch.

Such porting does not provide any value  addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.

Brief Work History    My involvement in the fields of SPED and REHAB extends back to the early 1970\\'s.  While an undergraduate student, I was employed as a drug rehabilitation and crisis intervention  counselor and I volunteered as a cub-scout master for a troop that integrated youth with  disabilities into the general troop. My work while achieving my M.Ed. and Ed.S., involved the  development and delivery of habilitation and educational services to person with developmental  disabilities. During that period I was a teacher, a director of a community educational program,  and performed research and demonstration activities at Kent State University. While in  Kentucky, I worked towards developing integrated and \"\"state of the art\"\" educational and  rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities. Further, I spent two years attempting to assist  persons with disabilities accessing appropriate employment outcomes. Upon returning to Ohio, I  worked with adults that had a college education, to access meaningful and appropriate  employment. In my role as Associate Director and Assistant Professor, my efforts focused on  systematically address education, employment, and transitional issues for persons with the full  range of disabilities. With my return to Kentucky as an Associate Professor of Special  Education, my focus has continued be on transition and employment issues for youth and adults  with disabilities. I have participated in a wide range of transition programs that include  consulting on two educational systems change grants (Kentuckys Transition Systems Change  Project and Kentuckys Severe Systems Change Project). Further, in Kentucky, I have directed  numerous state and federally funded demonstration and research grants in transition and  employment. I consult with the Kentucky Board of Education and the Kentucky Association of  School Boards on a variety of education issues. Until the summer of 2002 I was coordinator of  Kentuckys State Improvement Grant in Special Education (a federal grant designed to improve  special education services throughout the state). Since then, I have directed the special education  and distance education programs in special education, overseen numerous grants and projects,  and taught coursework in special education.

William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2006-2007)  Summary of Research and Scholarship:  I am a sociologist of higher education. Through research, writing, and teaching, I have contributed to our  understanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher  education. My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas\\xe2\\x80\\x94what facilitates it and  what impedes it within different types of colleges and universities\\xe2\\x80\\x94and identifies implications for academic  leaders who manage organizational change, knowledge change and professional socialization. Using theories  and methods from sociology, I analyze how organizational, intellectual, political, economic, and professional  interests redefine the content, structure, conduct, and relative legitimacy of academic fields.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Key studies include: the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields; dynamics of  professional socialization across disciplines; tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective  investment; the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education (1975-2000), a pivotal era of  changing societal expectations; forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration.  Serving in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry in  graduate education, leadership development, academic collaboration, and organizational change.  2    PUBLICATIONS  Books  Gumport, P.

Current Research:  American Government: Democracy in Transition (Pearson, under contract)  This book examines the American political system and its institutions as we transform from a  democracy of self-interest to one of increasing transparency and evidence-based decision  making. The book is designed for introductory American Government courses, and therefore  covers, in depth, the framers, constitutional theory, institutions, and participation  while  simultaneously engaging with a student population who may be only vaguely interested in  government.  Linking Science to Decision Making in Environmental Policy: Bridging the Disciplinary Gap (coauthored with Lawrence Becker, The MIT Press, under contract)  This book examines the role of science in moderating interest-based politics in resource  management and environmental stewardship. The manuscript builds a model of science based  policy processes where management decisions are based on stakeholder input but constrained  by scientific efficacy. Ultimately, the project is intended to develop a protocol to maximize crossdisciplinary decision making in environmental policy.  Environmental Deceptions: The Tension between Liberalism and Environmental Policymaking in  the United States (with Kristy Michaud; Albany: State University of New York Press, 2nd edition  under contract)  This book brings together normative analyses and empirical data to explain the structural  limitations liberal society places on environmental improvement. I argue that cultural  ambivalence toward communitarian ethics has made the traditional environmental  infrastructure problematic. The book exposes the subtle tensions that often lead to policy  failure, and suggests that traditional policy models are insufficient to resolve existing  environmental dilemmas in air, water, waste, and energy.

{"id": 321, "text": "\"Killer Legal Resumes  Resumes are an individual expression of who you are. They are also your one chance to make  a great first impression. The idea is to set yourself apart from the rest of the crowd, while still  maintaining the traditional professionalism required in the field of law.  Remember, the resume is not a complete autobiography! It is a prospectus for the future. Its  main task is to convince prospective employers to contact you for an interview. A good resume  should:  o  o  o    Be eye-appealing  Highlight your significant accomplishments  Be logically displayed for a 30-second (or less) review    Identify Your Skills  It is sometimes difficult to fully and effectively inventory and evaluate your own skills profile. Ask  yourself: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat special abilities have I developed which allowed me to perform successfully in  my previous activities/jobs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Do not be concerned that you have little or no previous experience  in legal jobs. Job skills are transferable. For example, the communications skills learned in a  retail position will be useful in your future legal career when counseling clients. Categorize your  skills as follows  all three categories are important and highly valued by employers!  o    Technical/Professional Skills  skills that are related to performing within a job and  acquired by education, training, reading, and/or hands-on experiences (i.e., internships,  clerkships, volunteer opportunities). These skills are often listed in advertised job  postings: e.g., legal research abilities, writing skills, working knowledge of a certain area  of law (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code).    o    Functional Skills  skills related to people, information, and things that are transferable  from one field to another (e.g., organization, communication, management, leadership).  These abilities are easy to overlook or downplay, but are highly valued by prospective  employers and crucial to successful workplace performance.    o    Personal/Adaptive Skills -- skills often referred to as personality and/or character traits  (e.g., patience, decisiveness, team player, self-starter, quick learner, detail-oriented,  work well under pressure).    Inventorying your Experiences/Resume Content  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Heading (name, address, email, telephone)    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Education/Honors/School-Related Activities (reverse chronological order)  o Education typically begins with college.  o List degree/year obtained or expected; names and locations of schools.  o Include your GPA if 3.0 or higher; class rank if in the top one-third    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Certificates/Licenses/Bar Admission(s)    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Professional/Work Experience  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Be specific! Include title, months and years of employment, name and location of  employer.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Instead of automatically listing job duties for each job, try to write  \"\"accomplishment statements\"\" that single out and spotlight your major  achievements. Accomplishment statements are far more compelling than a list of job  duties and responsibilities.  Think back on your previous positions and highlight any experiences that represent  achievements. To pinpoint achievements, some people think in terms of baseball and  ask, \"\"What were my triples and homeruns in that job?\"\" Once you identify the triples  and homeruns, write out an explanation of what you did. For additional help on how to  write accomplishment statements, go to www.careerlab.com/art_homeruns.htm.  It may be helpful to describe each experience using a P-A-R (Problem-Action-Result)  formula. Describe the Problem (or challenge/responsibility) you faced in the position,  Action(s) you took to reach an objective/goal, and the Result or accomplishment.  Contrast the effectiveness of these two statements:  Basic/Generic Description    Using P-A-R Formula    Performed legal research and  drafted a response to a motion  for summary judgment    Drafted successful opposition to  pivotal motion for summary  judgment in personal injury case  involving more than $10 million  in damages    List job duties where accomplishment statements are not feasible. Obviously, no  one hits triples and homeruns in every job. If you don\\'t have any significant  achievements in a particular job, it is perfectly acceptable to list your job duties and  responsibilities, but it need not be an exhaustive list. Stick to the more significant  ones that will be meaningful to the reader. A list of sample phrases for job duties as  well as accomplishment statements is included below.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Use action verbs to start each statement and omit personal pronouns (i.e., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). A list of action verbs is included below.  Quantify number of people, products, profits involved (e.g.,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Supervised 15-20  community volunteers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Volunteer, clinical, and/or internship experience  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 This may be your strong point! Always consider how you can \\xe2\\x80\\x9cput your best foot  forward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, presenting yourself as an experienced, capable candidate.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Professional Memberships/Activities/Publications    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Special skills (fluency in a foreign language; advanced computer skills if truly beyond  those skills expected)    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Activities/Interests (extracurricular activites, hobbies, interesting pursuits)    Format  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    One page (unless you have significant work experience, e.g. career before law school,  high level responsibility, etc.)  Professional, clean, easy-to-read typeface  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Standard 12 pt. font  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Reasonable margins    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Printed on high quality paper (limit color to white, cream, pale gray)  Use space to highlight information and make it easy to read    Tips and Traps  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Tailor your resume to the specific employer  o Be sure to include skills and experience sought by the employer  Proofread (for accuracy, grammar, punctuation, and correct telephone number)  No personal information! (i.e. marital status, children, etc.)  Have two other people proofread (perfection is key)  Before including anything on your resume, ask yourself this: Does this information  significantly contribute to your presentation? If not, exclude it.  Exclude photograph  Make sure that your voice-mail message is appropriate  Dont list references on your resume. Have a separate list available if requested. It is  important to select people as references who are familiar with your work skills. Ask  former employers or colleagues. Include their full names, job titles and addresses, along  with phone numbers and email addresses.

{"id": 332, "text": "\"Killer Legal Resumes  Resumes are an individual expression of who you are. They are also your one chance to make  a great first impression. The idea is to set yourself apart from the rest of the crowd, while still  maintaining the traditional professionalism required in the field of law.  Remember, the resume is not a complete autobiography! It is a prospectus for the future. Its  main task is to convince prospective employers to contact you for an interview. A good resume  should:  o  o  o    Be eye-appealing  Highlight your significant accomplishments  Be logically displayed for a 30-second (or less) review    Identify Your Skills  It is sometimes difficult to fully and effectively inventory and evaluate your own skills profile. Ask  yourself: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat special abilities have I developed which allowed me to perform successfully in  my previous activities/jobs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Do not be concerned that you have little or no previous experience  in legal jobs. Job skills are transferable. For example, the communications skills learned in a  retail position will be useful in your future legal career when counseling clients. Categorize your  skills as follows  all three categories are important and highly valued by employers!  o    Technical/Professional Skills  skills that are related to performing within a job and  acquired by education, training, reading, and/or hands-on experiences (i.e., internships,  clerkships, volunteer opportunities). These skills are often listed in advertised job  postings: e.g., legal research abilities, writing skills, working knowledge of a certain area  of law (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code).    o    Functional Skills  skills related to people, information, and things that are transferable  from one field to another (e.g., organization, communication, management, leadership).  These abilities are easy to overlook or downplay, but are highly valued by prospective  employers and crucial to successful workplace performance.    o    Personal/Adaptive Skills -- skills often referred to as personality and/or character traits  (e.g., patience, decisiveness, team player, self-starter, quick learner, detail-oriented,  work well under pressure).    Inventorying your Experiences/Resume Content  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Heading (name, address, email, telephone)    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Education/Honors/School-Related Activities (reverse chronological order)  o Education typically begins with college.  o List degree/year obtained or expected; names and locations of schools.  o Include your GPA if 3.0 or higher; class rank if in the top one-third    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Certificates/Licenses/Bar Admission(s)    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Professional/Work Experience  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Be specific! Include title, months and years of employment, name and location of  employer.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Instead of automatically listing job duties for each job, try to write  \"\"accomplishment statements\"\" that single out and spotlight your major  achievements. Accomplishment statements are far more compelling than a list of job  duties and responsibilities.  Think back on your previous positions and highlight any experiences that represent  achievements. To pinpoint achievements, some people think in terms of baseball and  ask, \"\"What were my triples and homeruns in that job?\"\" Once you identify the triples  and homeruns, write out an explanation of what you did. For additional help on how to  write accomplishment statements, go to www.careerlab.com/art_homeruns.htm.  It may be helpful to describe each experience using a P-A-R (Problem-Action-Result)  formula. Describe the Problem (or challenge/responsibility) you faced in the position,  Action(s) you took to reach an objective/goal, and the Result or accomplishment.  Contrast the effectiveness of these two statements:  Basic/Generic Description    Using P-A-R Formula    Performed legal research and  drafted a response to a motion  for summary judgment    Drafted successful opposition to  pivotal motion for summary  judgment in personal injury case  involving more than $10 million  in damages    List job duties where accomplishment statements are not feasible. Obviously, no  one hits triples and homeruns in every job. If you don\\'t have any significant  achievements in a particular job, it is perfectly acceptable to list your job duties and  responsibilities, but it need not be an exhaustive list. Stick to the more significant  ones that will be meaningful to the reader. A list of sample phrases for job duties as  well as accomplishment statements is included below.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Use action verbs to start each statement and omit personal pronouns (i.e., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). A list of action verbs is included below.  Quantify number of people, products, profits involved (e.g.,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Supervised 15-20  community volunteers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Volunteer, clinical, and/or internship experience  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 This may be your strong point! Always consider how you can \\xe2\\x80\\x9cput your best foot  forward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, presenting yourself as an experienced, capable candidate.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Professional Memberships/Activities/Publications    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Special skills (fluency in a foreign language; advanced computer skills if truly beyond  those skills expected)    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Activities/Interests (extracurricular activites, hobbies, interesting pursuits)    Format  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    One page (unless you have significant work experience, e.g. career before law school,  high level responsibility, etc.)  Professional, clean, easy-to-read typeface  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Standard 12 pt. font  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Reasonable margins    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Printed on high quality paper (limit color to white, cream, pale gray)  Use space to highlight information and make it easy to read    Tips and Traps  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Tailor your resume to the specific employer  o Be sure to include skills and experience sought by the employer  Proofread (for accuracy, grammar, punctuation, and correct telephone number)  No personal information! (i.e. marital status, children, etc.)  Have two other people proofread (perfection is key)  Before including anything on your resume, ask yourself this: Does this information  significantly contribute to your presentation? If not, exclude it.  Exclude photograph  Make sure that your voice-mail message is appropriate  Dont list references on your resume. Have a separate list available if requested. It is  important to select people as references who are familiar with your work skills. Ask  former employers or colleagues. Include their full names, job titles and addresses, along  with phone numbers and email addresses.

Again, remember that space on  your resume is crucial so dont waste it  on a meaningless line,    Separating your experience into  different categories, such as legal,  commercial and voluntary, makes it  easier for the reader. Jessica warns  against using subheads such as  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Relevant work experience; it suggests  that you think the rest of your CV is  irrelevant.  Quantify your major accomplishments and  contributions for each role. This can  include the money you saved or brought in  for your employer, deals closed, and  projects delivered on time or under  budget. Do not use any more than three to  five bullet points.  Many companies use some kind of  screening process to identify the right  candidates. You should include the  keywords mentioned in the job posting  throughout your resume. Identify the  common keywords, terminology, and key  phrases that routinely pop up in the job  descriptions of your target role and  incorporate them into your resume  (assuming you have those skills)  Dont list achievements in dense blocks of  text. Recruiters receive so many resumes  to scan through at a time, so make it as  easy as possible for them to understand  why youre perfect for the job. Dense  blocks of text are too difficult to read.  Ask as many friends and family to  proofread your application as necessary;  theres no room for typos in an application  to a law firm  youre trying to convince  people of your attention to detail. Using  the verb \\xe2\\x80\\x98advise rather than the noun  \\xe2\\x80\\x98advice could jeopardise your chances of  an interview. All lawyers need excellent  drafting skills and attention to detail.    Include any personal impact you had in a role  or position and quantify your impact where  possible. If you proposed a new idea, explain  briefly what it was and whether it was  implemented. As Harvey pointed out, \\xe2\\x80\\x98took  team from 14th to 4th rank at national  university league level shows the personal  impact this person has had on the team  Try not to lose momentum towards the  end of the CV. This section helps the  recruiter build up a picture of what  makes you tick. You could pull out  various tasks here but think about what  lawyers do: they pitch for new work and  have to meet regular deadlines, under  pressure.

{"id": 351, "text": "\"RESUME  WILLIAM P. ALLISON    CAREER SUMMARY  For thirty-two years, Bill Allison has practiced and taught law in Austin, Texas. He began his  career as a lawyer with the Community Legal Services Program, a law office sponsored by The  University Of Texas School Of Law. When the program was absorbed by the Travis County  Legal Aid and Defender Society in 1972, he became a Legal Aid lawyer. In both these positions  he supervised law students in one of the Law Schools earliest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclinical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d programs, what today is  called an externship.  In 1975, Mr. Allison was recruited to be a full time Lecturer at the UT School Of Law, teaching  and supervising students in the newly formed Criminal Defense Clinic (CDC). The CDC was the  Law Schools first true clinic with an academic component. In 1977, Mr. Allison and a student  attorney appealed one of the Clinics early cases, a free speech case, to the United States Supreme  Court and won. Also in 1977, Mr. Allison opened his first private practice in Austin,  concentrating on federal and state criminal defense, while remaining on the faculty half-time as a  Lecturer to continue teaching and supervising CDC students. He began teaching trial advocacy  for the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in 1978 and has taught more than fifty, one- to threeweek trial advocacy courses for lawyers and for law students at various venues around the nation.  In Fall 1995, Mr. Allison was invited to teach a seminar entitled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFranz Kafka and the Systems  of Punishment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Plan II Honors program at UT. He taught that course through the fall  semester of 2002, then turned the course over to the Hon. Robert Pitman, a UT Law School and  CDC graduate, and now a United States Magistrate for the Western District of Texas. Mr. Allison  retired from the la w school faulty after the summer semester, 2002, and has devoted himself to  his private practice. In January 2004, Mr. Allison returned to teaching full time as a Clinical  Professor of Law and Director of the Criminal Defense Clinic.  From 1993 to 1999, Mr. Allison served as Editor-in-Chief of Voice for the Defense, the monthly  magazine of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. He is recognized in The Best  Lawyers in America. In June, 2001, he was named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBest Defense Lawyer of the Year\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for 20002001, by the Criminal Justice Section of the State Bar of Texas. In November 2003, Texas  Monthly Magazine named him one of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuper Lawyers of Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (a peer reviewed award) and  one of the top fifty (50) lawyers for Central and West Texas. He has been listed in Woodward &  Whites Best Lawyers in America since 1996, and has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA/V\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rated by Martindale -Hubble  for over twenty years.  In recent years, Mr. Allison has worked to obtain the exoneration of innocent individuals who  have been wrongfully convic ted, cases of actual innocence. He and a team of lawyers recently  won the release of a young man who had spent more than 12 years in prison for a murder he did  not commit. Mr. Allison also won the exoneration for another innocent man who had spent 16  years in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. Recently, he was part of the team that won  a $5.3 million civil rights settlement for one of these exonerated individuals. He has just  achieved the commutation of a death penalty case in Texas for a mentally retarded man. This was  a court appointed case on which he worked for over six years.  In the Fall of 2003, along with David Sheppard and Prof. Robert Dawson, Mr. Allison  incorporated the Texas Center for Actual Innocence as a Section 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt, non-    1    profit corporation to find and assist actually innocent inmates who are serving long-term or death  penalty sentences. Through the generous cooperation of the UT School Of Law and the Austin  law firm of Graves Daugherty Hearon and Moody, the Center has prepared a syllabus, written a  manual, recruited an initial class of ten students out of fifty applicants, and screened the first  inmate requests. This hybrid class is privately funded, with little or no cost to the law school.  CURRENT  Principal, Law Office of William P. Allison, Austin, Texas.

{"id": 353, "text": "\"19 Legal CVs  Guidelines  Clear headings with different text size help the reader find the information they want. Fancy  styles and fonts are better suited to CVs for creative jobs  A two page CV is normally expected. Early in your degree when you have limited experience,  you might want to use a single-sided CV for speculative applications  Putting your name in a footnote can help avoiding the pages getting separated when the  employer prints it out. If printing yourself, use good quality white or cream paper  Law firms will expect your applications to be error free. Spell-check helps but dont rely on it  and pay attention to punctuation and appropriate use of capital letters. Its hard to pick up your  own errors, so try asking a friend to proof read for you  Recruiters like to find dates easily. One way is to put dates at the left margin, followed by the  name of the employer or place of study and job title or qualification obtained. Try to do this  across a single line  Style guides can ensure consistency of headings and accurate alignment of text but avoid  standardised CV templates which reduce the individuality of your document  Think what recruiters most want to know about you. Give most space and prominence to the  qualifications and experience that are most relevant. You can find out what some of the  leading legal recruiters are looking for at http://targetjobs.co.uk/career-sectors/lawsolicitors/applications-and-interviews/skills-graduate-recruiters-at-law-firms-lo.  LawCareers.net has similar information at  www.lawcareers.net/Information/Features/Detail.aspx?r=1269  Try to show that you can make a positive difference by concentrating on significant outcomes  from work experience and interests rather than listing everything youve done  Try to describe your skills in a way that is appropriate for a particular application. For example,  all lawyers need strong communication skills but the people you meet as a City lawyer are  different from the clients in high street practice, so select relevant examples from your own  communication experience  It is vital you check everything you have written as even the tiniest of errors will probably mean  your application is rejected. Youd kick yourself if all the hours spent on your CV content are  wasted.  A structure that suits most applications  Title. Putting \\xe2\\x80\\x98Curriculum Vitae is old-fashioned, so use your first and last names as the title. If  your first name could also be a last name, try putting your last name in bold or a larger font.  Personal details. You dont need to use the heading \\xe2\\x80\\x98Personal details but you normally include  address (and contact address if different); phone number(s) and email address(es)  but make  sure they are up to date. Nationality is optional but it is good to show that you have permission to  work in the UK if you are not an EEA or British national. If your gender is not obvious from your  name, you might wish to include it so that recruiters know how to address correspondence to you  or put in your title (Mr/Ms etc) to make it clear. Make sure this section looks professional by  avoiding email addresses that say too much about your personal life! The Kent careers website  gives examples of some addresses which might give recruiters the wrong impression!  www.kent.ac.uk/careers/cv.htm  Personal profile/career objective. A personal profile can work well if you have something very  specific that you want to highlight but recruiters dont like profiles such as \\xe2\\x80\\x98highly motivated,  ambitious law student with excellent communication and team working skills that look like    everyone elses and provide no evidence of the skills you claim to have. The sort that might work  is \\xe2\\x80\\x98Multilingual LLM student with a 1st at undergraduate level and six months international legal  experience\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.. in a single sentence this emphasises five things that could interest employers ie  languages, study at Masters level, excellent academic results, significant work experience and an  international perspective. A career objective might be similar but also mention what you are  looking for eg \\xe2\\x80\\x98seeking experience in banking law. It is hard to write the kind of profile which will  really make you stand out.  Education. This could also be entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x98Education and qualifications or \\xe2\\x80\\x98Education and awards.  Its usual to list qualifications in reverse chronological order, stating degree modules and grades  as well as A level and GCSE grades. Mention your dissertation either for the relevance of the  content to the firm or for the research, analytical and organisational skills it developed. Use  columns and list A levels or GCSEs in as few lines as possible to save space. You dont need to  name every GCSE subject but recruiters will be interested in number of A*, A and B grades and  you could mention grades (if good) for core subjects such as English, maths and modern  languages. Include any major academic prizes you won in school, college or university. Include  academic qualifications only; other qualifications such as IT skills certificates could go into a skills  section if relevant.  Legal experience. List in reverse chronological order and include voluntary work. You can  include attendance at open days and activities like the TARGETchances events as well as work  experience. Emphasise your most significant achievements, knowledge gained and skills learned  rather than listing every single thing you have done and give the most space to significant  responsibilities. Use bullet points, be concise and avoid repetition if you have done the same work  on several occasions.  Other work experience. You may have non-legal experience that is particularly relevant to your  legal applications. Examples include commercial experience for commercial law or  welfare/advisory work for legal aid or public sector practice. If so, you could make this a separate  section. Avoid detailed descriptions of everything you did in casual jobs, but give a brief overview,  information on any unusual achievements, such as rapid promotion or extra responsibility, and  describe transferable skills. While bar work might not seem very relevant, successfully handling  awkward customers will probably have developed your ability to defuse most difficult situations.  Skills. Most of your skills will be evident in your descriptions of work experience and  extracurricular activities, but you might have a short section detailing skills such as IT competence,  languages and driving licence. Different firms will be interested in different languages; those doing  multinational business normally like European languages and those relating to other countries in  which they operate, whereas an immigration practice will welcome languages that are relevant to  their clients.  Interests and achievements. Use a heading that emphasises your particular strengths such as  positions of responsibility or voluntary work. Think what your activities say about you  bigger  firms of solicitors like sports, other team activities and evidence of outstanding achievement. Aim  to show yourself as a rounded and interesting person who can manage your time well enough to  combine getting a good degree with extra curricular activities. But if you have had to work long  hours in a part-time job during your degree and this has limited your time for hobbies, dont be  afraid to mention this under work experience  you could just indicate the number of hours you  work in an average week  CV examples  Look at the CV examples and sample covering letters but dont be tempted to simply copy either  style or content. Your CV is likely to be the first contact you have with a firm, so take the time to  produce the best document possible. Note that larger firms have their own application forms and  will not normally accept CVs.

The concept, sold as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMetaxerol\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, (U.S. Patent #5,660,852; coinventor) was taken from idea to market profit in two years.  Completely computerized all diets at the zoos in Denver, San Antonio, Tyler (Tx), Tucson  and New Orleans  Isomeric forms of vitamin E vary in bioavailability. As a leading proponent of the  application of this insight, birth of endangered exotic species occurred at New Orleans  (Gorilla and Orangutan, 1996), and Tyler, Texas (Black Rhino, 1993) and African elephant  pregnancy confirmed (10/97) at Great Adventure Safari, New Jersey.

But one  resume does not fit all. This article  offers tips and suggestions on how to  weave your specialized areas of practice into your resume and make sure  it is tailored to fit your career path.  The American Dietetic Association  offers several resources for those pursuing new employment, including networking opportunities on the local and  national level, ADACareerLink, and  Job Descriptions: Models for Careers in  Dietetics, now in its second edition and  full of job description models for RDs  in clinical, business and consultation,  research, management, and public  health.

However, the resume is often what gets an applicants  foot in the door.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany people still get caught in the  This article was written by  Jennifer Mathieu, a freelance  writer in Houston, TX. Mathieu is  a former editorial assistant for  the Journal and has journalism  degree from Northwestern  University.

While reporting for the Houston  Press, she received awards from  the Association of Alternative  Newsweeklies, the Dallas Press  Club, the State Bar of Texas, and  the Gay & Lesbian Alliance  Against Defamation.  doi: 10.1016/j.jada.2010.01.004    trap of writing one resume and sending  the same one out to all potential employers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Susan Laramee, MS, RD,  LDN, FADA, manager of clinical recruitment for Sodexo, Inc (Gaithersburg, MD). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany resumes are very generic. If you dont address the skills the  hiring manager is seeking, it is unlikely that you will be invited for an  interview.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Laramee finds the traditional practice of listing an objective to be unnecessary but does believe its important  that credentials and contact information are at the top of the resume and  easy to spot. Because many jobs now  require applicants to apply online,  Laramee says it is key to make sure  your e-mail address is accurate and is  hyperlinked, providing for easy use.  Some of the stronger resumes  Laramee has seen when recruiting for  management positions have been  those that have a bulleted summary  of skills at the top of a resume, for  example, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn-depth comprehension of  principles of nutrition,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDemonstrated capability in customer service,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlexibility to work alone or  as a team member\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (see Figure 1).  BE SPECIFIC  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJob candidates should use strong  verbs like generate, implement, enhance, and improve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Laramee.  In addition to action verbs, specificity  in language is also necessary, especially when tailoring your resume as all  mid-career RD should do, say those interviewed for this article. Mary Jane  Rogalski, MBA, RD, LDN, manager  of clinical nutrition at Baystate  Medical Center in Springfield, MA,  and the chair of the Clinical Nutrition Management dietetic practice  group, looks for details that paint a  clear picture of an RDs previous  employment.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWords like, assessed patient needs  wont do much to describe the type of  patient or the type of facility,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Rogalski. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn a clinical resume, I expect to  see words that describe involvement  with high nutrition risk patients, like    \\xc2\\xa9 2010 by the American Dietetic Association    percentage tube feeding or percentage  total parenteral nutrition. There needs  to be a heavier emphasis on diagnostic  skills\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (see Figure 1). Clinicians in the  inpatient environment should specify  whether they have worked in a trauma  center, teaching hospital, or community hospital as the level of patient nutrition acuity will vary by the type of  institution, says Rogalski. And clinicians in the outpatient environment  would be wise to include specific counseling skills, such as motivational interviewing, when working with clients  outside the hospital environment.  Of course, specificity is not limited to  clinical dietitians resumes. Public health  and community dietitians would want  to provide specific demographics about  the communities they have served  in the past along with measurable  achievements in those communities. A  public health nutritionist would also  want to include his or her knowledge  and experience with population-based  nutrition interventions, community organizing and mobilizing, breastfeeding  education and promotion, and familiarity with government-sponsored programs such as WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,  Infants, and Children). An RD working  in a school environment would need to  list experience and familiarity with federal and state nutrition standards such  as those set by the National School  Lunch Program. School-based dietitians would also need to address potential responsibilities including participating in quality initiatives and  gathering and analyzing data to evaluate and improve outcomes, developing  and coordinating the efforts of the foodservice staff in order to promote nutrition and healthy eating, and analyzing  menus and recipes for nutritional adequacy. An RD working with information technology and developing health  technologies would want to showcase  his or her experience working with  data management systems or knowledge of laws and regulations protecting  health data security and privacy (Figure 2).

Sample resume: Culinary nutrition consultant.    March 2010 \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION    357    BUSINESS OF DIETETICS  RDs applying for positions in consultation and business, such as corporate dietitians, food and nutrition policy consultants (Figure 3), and  culinary nutrition consultants (Figure 4), would also want so show off a  certain set of skills. A corporate dietitian may want to specify media  events in which he or she served as a  corporate spokesperson; a history of  attending trade shows, conferences,  and professional meetings; and brochures, Web sites, and promotional  materials he or she helped create. A  food and nutrition policy consultant  would most likely want to include  years of experience educating and lobbying members of Congress on nutrition topics, familiarity with legislation and regulation that impact the  nutrition industry, and experience  consulting with clients to develop targeted messages and responses to policies and regulations. A culinary nutrition consultant\\xe2\\x80\\x94whose primary  responsibilities might include writing  and editing cookbooks, public speaking,  and offering personal chef services\\xe2\\x80\\x94  would want to provide a publishing and    358    March 2010 Volume 110 Number 3    editing history, locations and class  sizes of nutrition-based cooking classes  and food demonstrations, and an understanding of Joint Commission and  food safety standards.  Laramee also suggests that for midcareer RDs, each previous place of employment include fewer bullets of information, and RDs with many years of  experience can probably omit entry-level  positions or simply list them without providing additional details. While many  RDs with lengthy careers need more  than one page, a resume should never be  more than two pages, Laramee advises.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe resume itself shows your skills  and qualifications in the way its organized and displayed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you  put too much irrelevant information in  your resume, youre showing that you  lack focus or have difficulty with decisions, and your resume will lack clarity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  INCLUDE RELEVANT INFORMATION  As for education and work history,  Laramee advises that RDs include only  relevant material. Information about a  high school diploma and courses taken  in college are generally irrelevant. Be    prepared to briefly and clearly explain  any gaps in work history, and if rereentering the workforce after time off  for family issues, be prepared to discuss  how you have maintained your skills  and kept up to date with new information during that gap.  RDs with extensive careers may  want to skip dates that reveal age,  such as the year a bachelors degree  was earned, says Laramee. Simply  listing the university and degree obtained is sufficient.  While certifications, registrations,  professional involvement, and awards  specific to the field are all important  to include, outside activities or positions outside of dietetics should not  be included unless they can somehow be tailored to fit the position  applied for.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had one applicant who included  information on her first career as a florist because she was able to discuss the  customer service skills she had as a  small business owner,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Rogalski.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose skills could be connected to the  patient service skills she was going to  have to take on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    BUSINESS OF DIETETICS  NAME    Mary Doe, PhD, RD    DEPARTMENT    Medical Affairs    LOCATION    Boston, MA, USA    EDUCATION  2004    PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  2007 to Present    PhD, Nutritional Biochemistry and Human Metabolism  Tufts University Freidman School of Nutrition Science and Policy  Boston, MA, USA  Director, Endocrinology, Metabolic Disease and Cardiology  Acme Research Company    Perform literature searches, write case studies, internal and external education, and support all efforts at bid defense meetings  Heavy involvement with operations groups as well as other business segments  Manage nutrition operations in the endocrinology and cardiology therapeutic area for this fast growing, medically focused and state of the art  global CRO  Responsible for medical/clinical components of the following product/service areas: clinical research and data analysis, study feasibility, study  design and protocol development, reporting and publishing, consulting, and overall service delivery  Serve as lead dietitian and nutritionist for the endocrinology and cardiology therapeutic business unit, and act as major \\xe2\\x80\\x9cout front\\xe2\\x80\\x9d person for the  enterprise  LICENSURE/CERTIFICATION  2001 to Present    PROFESSIONAL MEMBERSHIPS  2000-2007    EDITORIAL BOARDS  2004 to Present    Licensed Dietitian/Nutritionist  Board of Dietitians and Nutritionist  Division of Professional Licensure  Commonwealth of Massachusetts  Boston, MA, USA  Ex-officio Member, General Clinical Research Center  Scientific Advisory Committee  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  Ad hoc reviewer, Obesity Research    BIBLIOGRAPHY  1.

March 2010 \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION    359    BUSINESS OF DIETETICS  THE CV  According to Jeanene Fogli, PhD, RD,  chair of the Research dietetic practice  group, its important to note that the  research and education field may require a different type of resume\\xe2\\x80\\x94a curriculum vitae (known as a CV)\\xe2\\x80\\x94when  applying for jobs. Whether applying to  academic positions or for-profit research positions (such as working for a  pharmaceutical company), interested  applicants will most likely create a CV.  Fogli, a director of medical and scientific affairs for i3 Research (Basking  Ridge, NJ), says a CV will include educational and professional experience,  but unlike a resume will also include a  publishing history and a list of editorial  boards the applicant is a member of  (see Figure 5 for a sample CV).  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA publication history is key,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says  Fogli. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are applying to a for-profit  company, they want to sell your expertise, and a publishing history is part of  that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fogli adds that all applicants for  research positions should include details on any exposure to clinical research and highlight any additional  coursework in the sciences. A strong  research dietitians CV will also specify  experience with regulatory filings for  agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as well as familiarity with  commonly used standardized research  measures such as the National Heart,  Lung, and Blood Institutes iliac waist  measurement. Fogli adds that potential employers are looking for future  employees who will not need to be  trained in specific differences between  a phase I and phase III trial and who  will not need to be educated in the use  of common measurements.  Applicants should also include any  funding they have received, such as  listing a percentage of salary support  for a particular study and identifying  the funder. (For example, a CV may  state 40% salary support for a study on  the effect of jelly beans on the diet with  funding coming from The National  Jelly Bean Board.) According to Fogli,  there is not one set standard for where  in the CV this information should be  included although it should appear  prominently.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are expected to bring in research dollars,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Fogli. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you  have a history of doing that, thats a  bonus, so include it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    360    March 2010 Volume 110 Number 3    ONLINE RESUMES  Many of the popular job and professional networking sites, such as Monster, Hot Jobs, or LinkedIn, as well as  other niche Web sites or services like  ADACareerLink, have you create a  profile where you can upload a resume,  or several, or have you create a resume  using their resume form. Some job sites  let you apply for positions by simply  submitting your profile information. In  these instances, you should edit your  profile so that it specifically reflects the  job for which you are posting. However,  most job sites either provide contact information with an e-mail address  where you should send your resume or  provide a link directly to the employers  Web site where contact information is  provided or you have to fill out an online form.  In these cases, its a good idea to create your resume in several formats: a  print version, a scannable version, and  a plain text version. A print version can  contain italicized or underlined text,  different fonts and sizes, bulleted lists,  and other design elements. This copy  should be used hand to contacts and  interviewers or sent via mail. A scannable version, to send as an e-mail attachment or upload as a file to a Web  site, should contain limited design elements as it is first viewed by a computer and then uploaded to a database  where employers can search resumes  based on keywords. Design elements  and text formatting can interfere with  the scan. For scannable resumes, use  one common font (such as Times New  Roman) throughout (1). Instead of increasing the size of the font, use spacing to break up sections (1). Also, avoid  using bullets, tables, and visuals in a  scannable resume; instead, use dashes,  left-justified text, and simple spacing  (1). A plain text version, or text-only  copy, is a version you should have  available to cut and paste into online  forms or the body of an email. As the  name implies a plain text version contains no design elements.  Whichever format is used, you  want to create a resume specifically  for the job you are applying for.  Also, remember to update all the  versions of your resume; otherwise,  you may update your print version and  accidently send out a scannable version  that wasnt updated.    ADAPT  Fogli adds that positions that include  presenting to clients\\xe2\\x80\\x94research or otherwise\\xe2\\x80\\x94may require the applicant to  supply a video of such a presentation,  so the hiring company can see performance in action.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of the biggest mistakes applicants make is not finding out more  about the position and its requirements  beforehand and not tailoring their resume to the job,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Laramee.  Whether an RDs interest is clinical,  public health, research, or another area  in dietetics, experts agree it is important to have a second or even third  party review the finished resume or CV  for spelling and grammar errors, say  those interviewed for the article. And  above all, be specific in what you create.  Showcasing your specialty areas and  how they apply to the position you are  vying for could mean all the difference  when looking for new opportunities  and expanding your career.  The editors would like to thank Cindy  Krainen, RD, of Harper Associates;  Susan Laramee, MS, RD, LDN, of Sodexo and past ADA President; and Susan Moores, MS, RD, chair of ADAs  Member Value Committee, for their  contributions to this article.
