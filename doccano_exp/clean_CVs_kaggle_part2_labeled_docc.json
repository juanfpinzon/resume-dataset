Font: Choose a font style and size that is clean and  conservative, and stay between 10 and 12 points in  size. Choose one font style and use it throughout. Your  name can be two points larger.  Good font examples include: Times New Roman  and Verdana  Font Style: Bold, italics, underlining and CAPITALIZATION  can highlight certain information you want to  emphasize. Dont overuse these enhancements;  otherwise, nothing really stands out.  Dates: Use a consistent pattern for all dates. Use years  for all jobs if you do not know the exact months for all  jobs (i.e., 20012002).  Paper Color: Be conservative, use white or off-white.  Spacing: A 1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1.25\\xe2\\x80\\x9d margin all around is generally acceptable; leave plenty of white space.  Number of Pages: A resume is usually 12 pages. Your  resume may have more than two pages if:  You are submitting a curriculum vitae rather than a  resume, OR you have an extensive list of:  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\t Technical qualifications  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\t Credentials and certifications  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\t Publications  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\t Honors, awards, commendations  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\t Special projects, etc.  Regardless of the type of resume you choose, write  it to catch the interest of the person reading it. Most  resumes get a 515 second scan the first time. From  this, a decision is made to look further or not. This  makes the first half of your resume extremely important.  Use this space to give a well-written summary of your  strengths and skills. Format the rest of the resume to  highlight your skills using accomplishment statements.    Write with Goals in Sight  You should arrange your resume based on your goal.  Are you looking for work in a field where you have  experience, or are you changing careers? Have you  recently completed school, or are the job requirements  education focused?  Consider what the employer is looking for when you  choose what to include on your resume and the order  you present it.    Summarize \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 to Set Yourself Apart  Hiring managers and recruiters are busy people. One  job posting or want ad can generate thousands of  responses and stacks of resumes. You want to create  a resume that separates you from the stack. Begin  with a summary or objective that captures attention.  Consider using a bulleted list of your abilities or  accomplishments \\xe2\\x80\\x94 its easier to see and scan on  the resume. A well-developed summary is useful in a  networking situation or in an interview.    Keep It Updated  Be certain to print the most updated contact  information on your resume. If you decide to have an  e-mail address or phone number listed on your resume  be sure to keep it up-to-date and accurate.    Decide Whats Optional  Listing a physical address may not always be necessary.  An employer probably doesnt need to know your address and the city in which you live unless relocation for  the job is an issue. Omitting your address can allow for  more room on the resume \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and this sometimes makes  the difference when attempting to limit the resume to a  single page.

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a  great place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of  skills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more  specific to your major, intended industry, or job function.  A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action  verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified  through the accomplishment statement.    IV.

Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements  under each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently  graduated with a bachelors degree, those who are staying within the same career field,  and candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred  by employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and  clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories.

Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight  transferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and  employers.    VI.

Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics  The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,  and skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,  think of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect  candidate for the opportunity at hand.  Resume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best  practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content  and a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with  regard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify  the skills you possess and employers are seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should  keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing  elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the readers eye to rest.  Using .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A  10-12 point font size is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold  a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,  dates, etc. line up neatly on the page.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully  read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least  2-3 people proofread it as well.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when  you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,  quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry  or job function-specific) and transferable skills.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the  skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily  scan your resume for what he or she is seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is  assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy duties included...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy responsibilities  were\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.  Also, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your  most important information stands out.    3    II. Key Elements of a Successful Resume  Your First and Last Name  \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Phone number \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Email address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Street address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 City, state & zip code \\xe2\\x99\\xa6  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  OBJECTIVE  Create a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area  you are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be  omitted or substituted with a \\xe2\\x80\\x95Career Highlights\\xe2\\x80\\x96 or \\xe2\\x80\\x95Summary of Qualifications\\xe2\\x80\\x96 section.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  EDUCATION  Institution City, State  (Expected) Graduation Month Year  Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations  GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)  Other possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  TECHNICAL SKILLS   Utilities   Languages   Software   Databases   Hardware  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  EXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   The position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of  the Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.   You can bold or italicize your title or your organization\\xe2\\x80\\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.   In this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the  skills employers are seeking.   Start with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when  possible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or  more skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.   Consider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?  What were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does  this experience relate to your internship/employment goal?  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   Bulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.   Be specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.   Make sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or  making it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   Using multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant  experience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.   Positions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.   In an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are  applying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.   Emphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.  Organization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter)  City, State Month Year - Month Year   This section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,  professional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \\xe2\\x80\\x95job title\\xe2\\x80\\x96 with the role you played.    4    III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs  TRANSFERABLE SKILLS  Transferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those  that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your bulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following:  CLERICAL  Bookkeeping  Classifying  Collecting  Compiling  Computing  Examining  Filing  Organizing  Recording  Word processing    PROBLEM SOLVING  Analyzing  Appraising  Diagnosing  Examining  Executing  Planning  Proving  Reasoning  Recognizing  Validating    TECHNICAL  Adjusting  Aligning  Assembling  Drafting  Engineering  Installing  Observing  Operating  Programming  Repairing    CREATIVE  Designing  Developing  Establishing  Illustrating  Imagining  Improvising  Inventing  performing  Revitalizing  Visualizing    RESEARCH  Assessing  Calculating  Collecting  Diagnosing  Evaluating  Examining  Extrapolating  Interviewing  Investigating  Synthesizing    TRAINING  Adapting  Communicating  Demonstrating  Enabling  Encouraging  Evaluating  Explaining  Instructing  Planning  Stimulating    ACTION VERBS  Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a  reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary  the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences. Below is a list of verbs to help get you started.

Satellite kits are distributed to catastrophe teams following a storm to allow the teams to communicate with  Corporate, over the network, until such time that a T1 line can be installed. (1) When client hardware  (computers, VOIP Services, etc.) is attached to the network it starts to broadcast its desire for a DHCP address.  (2) Once the VSAT router sees this request it converts it into a directed IP packet to the primary DHCP server.  (3) The packet transverses the satellite connection and is (4 & 5) finally delivered to the DHCP server. The  same scenario occurs when the client machine tries to renew its address except that the request goes directly  to the primary DHCP server instead of broadcasting its request.    \\xc2\\xa0  Responsibilities   \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Developing XML interfaces, creating Class structures in C++ and coding it  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Developed C++/XML interface for circuit automation  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Coded and implemented event handler in C++.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Involved in trouble shooting the issues in production and bug fixing programs in C  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Involved in requirement gathering meetings, brainstorming sessions and detailed design meets.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Fine Tuning SQLs and Pro*C code.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Do the System Testing and work on the CSM switches which cannot be handled at offshore.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Do extensive code reviews and suggest optimization if needed.

{"id": 271, "text": "\"Undergraduate Resume Guide  Your resume is an important tool to market your experiences to prospective employers. It is a professional written document that  communicates your education, work experiences, and skills related to the type of position you are seeking.    TO GET STARTED:  1) Make a list of experiences youve had: Education and training, jobs, internships, research, projects, volunteer work, leadership,  student organizations, etc.  1) Think about what you contributed, what skills you used and developed, and your significant achievements.  2) Begin to craft your resume by organizing these experiences into sections (examples below).  A resume should always include your contact information, education, and experience. Additional resume categories described  below are common sections that may enhance your resume. Keep in mind that the resume you use to apply for a particular  position should address the skills and qualifications outlined in the job description, therefore your resume is a fluid document that  should continually change.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________    CONTACT INFORMATION:  Include your name, present and/or permanent address, telephone number, and email address.  Example of Contact Section:    Goldy Gopher  7890 West Sixth Avenue  Anytown, MN 55698  444-444-1234  goldy@umn.edu  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________    OBJECTIVE:  A brief statement that indicates what type of position you are seeking. It may also include key skills you bring to the position, which  type of industry you want to work in, and/or what company you want to work for. When applying for a specific position, tailor your  objective to match the qualifications of the job description and address the companys needs. If an employer requests a resume  and cover letter, an objective statement is probably unnecessary as you are addressing your qualifications through the cover letter  you submit. If you chose to include an objective statement, make sure that it is well written and enhances your resume.  Examples of Objective Statements:  Objective: To obtain the mechanical engineering internship with XYZ company that will utilize my design experience and  technical skills.

Over the years you have developed many skills through your  coursework, extracurricular activities, and life experiences. Review the list below and identify which transferrable skills you have  and reflect on how you acquired these skills. Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the  skills gained from these experiences. For example, if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote, edited, and presented a  final research paper in front of your peers, you have used skills (gathering information, writing, problem-solving, presenting) which  are not limited to that specific academic discipline, but are transferable to many occupations.    Research and  planning    Human relations    Organizing,  management and  leadership    Work survival    The skillful expression  and interpretation of  knowledge and ideas.    The search for specific  knowledge and the ability  to conceptualize future  needs and solutions.    The use of interpersonal  skills for resolving  conflict, relating to and  helping people.    Ability to supervise and  guide individuals and  groups in the  completion of goals.    The daily skills that  assist in promoting  effective production and  work satisfaction.    Speaking effectively    Predicting    Developing  relationships    Initiating new ideas    Implementing decisions    Writing effectively    Creating theories and  ideas    Being sensitive    Handling details    Cooperating    Identifying problems    Listening    Coordinating tasks    Enforcing policies    Imagining alternatives    Conveying feelings    Managing groups    Being punctual    Identifying resources    Providing support    Delegating  responsibility    Managing time    Gathering information    Motivating    Teaching    Solving problems    Sharing credit    Perceiving non-verbal  messages    Coaching    Setting goals    Counseling    Advising    Presenting information    Extracting information    Cooperating    Promoting change    Accepting  responsibility    Describing feelings    Defining needs    Delegating with respect    Interviewing    Developing evaluations    Representing others    Selling ideas or  products    Setting and meeting  deadlines    Editing    Creating spreadsheets  and databases    Perceiving feelings,  situations    Decision making with  others    Organizing    Calculating results    Asserting    Communication    Listening attentively  Expressing ideas  Facilitating discussions  Negotiating  Persuading    Attending to detail  Meeting goals  Enlisting help    Making decisions  Managing conflict    Page 3    ACTION VERBS:  Action verbs are an effective way to begin a skills statement.

Generally, a bachelors level candidate  should stick to a one-page resume. If your resume is two pages, only print on one side of the paper, and your second page  should include your name and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPage 2.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Avoid using a resume template. This does not allow the opportunity to personalize and to make changes\\xe2\\x80\\x94and your resume is  an ever changing document.  Your resume should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends an average of 20-30  seconds scanning your resume\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications.  To organize your resume, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these  sparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead  of traditional, round, solid bullet points.  It is a good idea to start with a one-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Your font size should be  between 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy-to-read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond.  Keep your font size and style consistent throughout your resume (except for your name, which should be a larger size).  Present your resume on quality bond paper (20 pound)\\xe2\\x80\\x94stick with white and off-white to ensure your resume is easy to read.  If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your resume directly, keep the format simple when filling  in the required information.  If you are requested to submit your resume via email, save your resume and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include  a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose.    TIPS FOR RESUME WRITING:                          Make sure that your resume is a unique and personal document. It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes but also  important to make it your own. Please see the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResume Examples Binder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Resource Center.  There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume, but there are also options and room for choice. If you give  your resume to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines,  resumes are subjective.  Be 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations.  Organize your resume so the most relevant information is at the top.  Do not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of  skill.  Personal information, such as marital status, age, height, weight, etc. should not be included.  Avoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action  verbs.  References are a separate document from your resume. Reference documents should include your contact information as it  appears on your resume. List the name, title, company name, address, phone, and email of each reference (see example on  Pg. 9).  Always proofread your resume. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors.  It is suggested to tailor your resume to the job description. You may have more than one version of your resume depending on  the positions you are applying for. Employers may do a key word search of the resumes submitted to find those that meet the  job requirements.  Remember that your resume is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employers first impression of you. It is also a work in  progress that you will continually revise.    CURRICULUM VITAE (CV):        A CV is a type of resume most commonly used to apply for research or faculty positions in an academic setting.  A CV is typically longer in length and provides more detail than a resume. In addition to the basics that you would include on a  resume, it is common to include publications, presentations, research and teaching experiences, grants, fellowships, and  awards.    ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:          Visit www.cse.umn.edu/career to view our Resume Writing Workshop  Visit the Resource Center to view our Resume Examples Binder and related books  Have your resume reviewed by a CSE Career Counselor. You can email it to csecareer@umn.edu. If you would like to meet with  a CSE Counselor to discuss, you can make a 30-45 minute appointment or stop by during Drop-In Advising and Career  Counseling hours (paper copy only; no laptops).

I am  interested in computer vision and machine learning.    Major Projects  Improving Performance with MKL in SVMs    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Dr. Manik Varma, MSR India  Dr. Prateek Jain, MSR India  Summer Internship and B.Tech Project  May 2010 - Present  Support Vector Machines learn linear classifiers from labelled training data to predict labels for previously unseen test data. Kernels with SVMs allow to learn non linear classifiers, and hence lead to much  higher classification accuracies in practice. We are learning non linear kernel combinations to give  us even better classification accuracies and are seeing a possibility of a significant performance increase.  Also, looking at new regularizers (which take into account the model complexity) for use in the MKL  objective. Working towards submitting this to one of ICML, NIPS or ECCV.  Unsupervised Video Surveillance  Prof. Subhashis Banerjee, CSE, IITD  Student Undergraduate Research Award (SURA - 2009)  May 2009 - October 2009  This project involved the development of a novel technique to detect unusual activities in videos in an  unsupervised manner. We used pLSA with an appropriate choice for features on video clips to obtain  clustering of similar videos, and any new activity different from the ones learnt was flagged as unusual.  We also extended the idea to multi person unusual activity detection.

Using Structural Information for Object Recognition  Prof. Subhashis Banerjee  Computer Vision Course Project  April 2010  I investigated various feature vectors and techniques and frameworks for incorporating structural information in object recognition tasks.  Non Photo-realistic Rendering  Prof. Prem Kalra  Digital Image Analysis Course Project  September 2010  Implemented color quantization, dithering, image segmentation and edge enhancement (by edge linking,  differential thickening and smoothing) to give a painterly look to photo-realistic images.  Knowledge Management  Prof. Subhashis Banerjee  Independent Project  January 2010 - October 2010  Conceptualized new web 2.0 based IT services such as Interest Group Discussion Forums, Campus    Wiki, Project Database to allow easier collaboration, better information organization and formalizing  undocumented technical know how. Designed intuitive user interfaces and work-flows for these services  and customized existing open source drupal and foswiki project (by adding kerberos authentication,  LDAP integration), to finally deploy these services in the institute.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Funny Cell  Assistant Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth  Computer Networks Course Project  March 2010 - April 2010  This project was based on a molecule based inter-cell communication simulator designed by our professor.

The cover letter  introduces you and your resume to the reader, and the resume gives a more complete overview of your  experience and qualifications. Together, these important marketing tools show where the match is between  you and the position description and determine if youll be interviewed.  Your resume and cover letter must be geared to your audience. Before you start writing:  Assess yourself. Know what skills and experience you bring to the table. Come talk!  Research the field so you can use its keywords in your resume and cover letters, important whether  your docs are being scanned by computer or read by a person. Consult our guide, Your Job Search.  Analyze the description of position for which youre applying. Notice the key skills and competencies the employer  seeks. Identify specific examples in your resume that match these qualifications and stress these in your letter.  Guidelines on cover letter writing begin on page 6.    Getting Started on Your Resume  Whether writing your first resume or updating a previous one, it may help to begin with a master list of all  your jobs, internships, campus and community activities, special courses and projects, schools attended,  interests, travel, and skills. All this will not end up in your final resume, but you want to be sure you dont leave  out anything important. A professional resume is likely very different from your college application version.  Length  One page is standard for most fields and for most students and recent graduates. This is especially important  for business, technology, or communications firms (advertising or publishing, for example). Employers in many  other fields appreciate a concise and attractive one-page resume.  A longer resume is appropriate for certain applicants and fields. For teaching, a two-page resume is  acceptable if you have significant related experience. For fellowships, grants, or research jobs, you may need a  Curriculum Vitae, or C.V. A resume for federal jobs is often longer than one page. Speak with a career advisor if  you have any questions about what format is appropriate for your needs.  Format  Avoid templates or resume wizards. Your goal is to have your resume stand out in a positive way, and  template resumes often appear identical to those of many other applicants.  Arrange your education and experience in reverse chronological order, present to past. This lets your reader  easily see your current and recent background. You may also use categories relevant to your audience, for  example, Public Relations Experience, Laboratory Experience, and so forth.  Some fields require specialized resume formats. A C.V. may be needed for research, science positions, or  fellowships. For C.V. guidelines, please see Curriculum Vitae for Academic or Research Roles. Acting,  performance, or studio arts majors should consult Resumes for Actors and Artists. Note that many U.S.  employers asking for a C.V. may actually want a resume.  2    Writing a Resume Employers Will Read  Use action verb phrases to describe your experiences. Instead of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResponsibilities included training staff\\xe2\\x80\\x9c say  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrained five new staff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A list of action verbs is on page 5.  Be concise; omit personal pronouns and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whenever possible. Instead of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI created and  maintained a database using Excel,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCreated and maintained database using Excel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Stress accomplishments and results; quantify your results when appropriate. For example:  Draft #1: Waited tables. Opened and closed restaurant.  Draft #2: Provided customer service to patrons of high-traffic caf\\xc3\\xa9. Opened and closed restaurant.  Draft #3: Provided quality customer service to patrons of high-traffic caf\\xc3\\xa9, serving up to 100 meals  during busy lunch and dinner shifts. Developed loyal return clientele. Selected by manager over more  experienced wait staff to open and close restaurant. Totaled up to $200 in tips per shift.  Create different resumes for different audiences. All fields have different keywords and expectations of  resumes. If possible, have it reviewed by a professional in your field as well as the Lazarus Center.  Make it clear. Avoid confusing acronyms and abbreviations. Instead of S.O.S., say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cService Organizations of  Smith.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Its OK to use postal abbreviations for states, but be consistent.    Sections of a Resume  NAME. Put it at the top, centered or flush left. Use caps, bold, and a larger font to make it stand out.  CONTACT INFORMATION. List your current address, phone, and email on one line (saves space) or blocked.  Also list a permanent or forwarding address if its in your search region.  OBJECTIVE (optional). We suggest you omit an objective from your resume and state it in your cover letter.  SUMMARY or PROFILE (optional). More experienced applicants may begin with a summary geared to the  reader. For example: Five years communications and marketing experience in non-profit sector. Skilled  researcher, writer, and editor. Excellent public speaking and workshop facilitation skills. Strong fundraising  background with special expertise in grant writing. Experience recruiting, training, and motivating volunteers.    EDUCATION generally comes first for students and recent grads. From present to past, list school, location,  degree, date awarded or expected, major, minor, and concentration. Study away, other degrees, thesis, related  courses, projects, and research papers may be included. GPA is required for finance or consulting but optional  for other fields. If your combined SAT is 2100+, we suggest including it on a finance resume. List major and  cumulative GPA if you like.  High school experience is often included by first years and sophomores. Others may include it if relevant, for  example, if youre searching in the region where you attended high school or if you had significant high school  experience related to your objective.  HONORS and AWARDS, if you have them, may go under Education or as a separate category.    3    SKILLS can include languages, computer or lab skills, equipment use, and other skills relevant to your reader.  Include skills under Education or as a separate category. Add relevant licensing and certifications.  EXPERIENCE can include jobs, internships, volunteering, extracurricular activities, and course projects. From  present to past, list title, organization, location, and dates. (Put organizations first, titles second if you like, but  do so consistently.) Use specific titles such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdministrative Intern,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIntern,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d if your supervisor  approves. Choose headers stressing experience in your target field, for example, Museum Experience.  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE (also called Supporting Experience) is an optional category for content youd like to  include but is less directly relevant to your reader. You may use a second heading as described above.  ACTIVITIES, INTERESTS, SKILLS, TRAVEL, AFFILIATIONS. Choose headings that work for the rest of your  content. Be specific. Say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEnjoy modern British fiction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEnjoy reading.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Listing memberships that  reveal your race, ethnicity, religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or gender identity may encourage or  discourage employers from interviewing you. Feel free to consult a career advisor about your resume content.  DO NOT INCLUDE the statement \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences Available on Request.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Instead, prepare a separate page titled    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences for Your Name\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with your references names, titles, and contact info (with permission) to send if  requested. Personal statistics (age, height, weight) and a photograph are only appropriate for a performance  resume. Marital status is never included on a resume.  INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WISHING TO WORK IN THE US should use their Smith address and/or a US  address if you have one rather than an international address. Do not include your current visa status or  country of citizenship. It is illegal for employers to ask about these topics in the US, though they may ask  whether you have work authorization or will require visa sponsorship in the future. If you are a Permanent  Resident we suggest including this in a final \\xe2\\x80\\x9cActivities and Additional Background\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section. Questions? Please  see a career advisor about your resume and the international student advisor about work status regulations.    Making Your Resume Attractive and Easy to Read  Select a font size and style that are easy to read. We suggest 10-12 point size in familiar fonts such as Arial,  Times New Roman, or Garamond. Try a slightly larger font for headings and name.  Adjust the margins to fit your content. 1.0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d margins are typical, but not a strict requirement.  Use capital letters, bold type, italics, underlining, bullets, and spacing for emphasis.  Be consistent with spacing, dates, punctuation, and order of information. Details matter!  Proofread your resume carefully. Dont rely on spell check. Misspellings, grammar and punctuation errors,  and inconsistencies make a poor first impression. You may not be asked for an interview as a result.  For hard copy resumes, use bond paper (24 # weight is suggested) in white, cream, or gray. Use the same  paper for your letters and get matching envelopes. If using a watermarked paper, get the mark right-side up.  Use a letter quality printer with a fresh cartridge.  Keep your resume polished and up-to-date. Revise it as you gain new experiences or change directions. The  effort you put into this important marketing tool will be time well spent.  .    4    Action Verb List  The verbs listed below are only a few of the many you can use in describing your experience and  accomplishments. Make sure you have an action verb for each entry in your resume\\'s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExperience\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section.  accelerated    conceived    encouraged    interpreted    produced    simplified    accomplished    conducted    enlisted    introduced    programmed    solved    achieved    delegated    established    launched    promoted    specialized    adapted    demonstrated    estimated    led    proposed    stimulated    adjusted    designed    evaluated    lectured    proved    streamlined    aided    determined    examined    listed    provided    structured    allocated    developed    expanded    maintained    ran    substituted    amplified    devised    expedited    managed    received    suggested    analyzed    devoted    extended    modified    recommended    summarized    answered    diagnosed    fabricated    molded    reconciled    supervised    applied    diagrammed    focused    monitored    recorded    supported    appointed    directed    forecast    motivated    recruited    systematized    approved    distributed    fortified    negotiated    reduced    teamed    arbitrated    collaborated    founded    observed    re-established    trained    arranged    constructed    generated    operated    regulated    treated    assisted    consulted    guided    orchestrated    rehearsed    tutored    assumed    contracted    handled    organized    reinforced    unified    attained    contrived    harmonized    oriented    renegotiated    updated    augmented    controlled    headed    originated    reorganized    used    awarded    cooperated    implemented    oversaw    reported    utilized    began    coordinated    improved    overhauled    researched    volunteered    brought    counseled    incorporated    participated    reshaped    widened    built    created    increased    performed    restored    wrote    calculated    dealt    influenced    persuaded    revamped    catalogued    defined    initiated    planned    reviewed    chaired    edited    inspected    pinpointed    revised    compared    effected    installed    prepared    scheduled    compiled    eliminated    instituted    presented    selected    completed    employed    instructed    preserved    set up    5    Cover Letters: The First Impression  An employers first impression of you is often your cover letter, so it must engage their attention quickly and  convince them to take the time to read your resume. Your cover letter needs to show what makes you a great  fit for the position. It is not sufficient to say you have the skills required for the position or are interested in it.  First, research the field and organization. Go beyond the website\\xe2\\x80\\x94use press releases, journal/news articles,  annual reports, Google, LexisNexis, and informational interviews with alums and others. Knowledge of the  organization shows your initiative and enthusiasm for working there.  Review the job description; notice the skills sought and field-specific terms used. Identify specific examples  from your resume that demonstrate how youve used the skills the employer wants. Stress accomplishments  and results rather than simply listing your day-to-day responsibilities.  Whenever possible, address your letter to an actual person, not \"\"To Whom it May Concern.\"\" Phone or  email to get the recipients name and title if its not included in the position description. If you can\\'t get a  name, use a title such as \"\"Dear Director\"\" or \"\"Dear Internship Coordinator.\"\"  The cover letter is a sample of your writing and communication skills. It must be clear, concise, and free of  spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Keep it simple. Dense, academic language or slang are  inappropriate\\xe2\\x80\\x94this is a business letter.  Tailor each cover letter. Employers may receive dozens or even hundreds of applications for any given  position. Careful research, relevant examples, and specific reasons why this position and this organization  interest you will help distinguish your application.    Framing Your Story: Questions to Guide Your Cover Letter  Use the following to generate content for your cover letter. Though it need not answer every question, a  great letter will address many of these items and show youve considered the others:  Why are you interested in this position? This organization? This field/industry?  For what position are you applying?  What do you know about the organization, its work, clients/customers/products that especially  interests you?  What do you feel distinguishes this organization from its peers?  What specific skills and knowledge is the employer seeking for this position?  How have your prior experiences influenced your interest in this position/organization/field?  In what ways have your accomplishments during your prior experiences (extracurricular, volunteer,  work, other) prepared you to excel in this position?  What aspects of your academic experience will help you succeed in this position?  Compared to other applicants, how might you be uniquely qualified for the position?  How will the organization benefit from hiring you?  Having difficulty answering any of these questions? Revisiting the job description, further research, and  clarifying your skills and interests may help.  6    Cover Letter Format  Use standard business letter format for your letter. Refer to the following page for guidelines on address  format, greeting and closing, and spacing.  A cover letter should be no more than one page. Keep the paragraphs short and easy to read. Use a 10-12  point font size in the same font style as your resume. Set the margins so the letter is visually balanced on the  page (1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is standard). For hard copy applications, use matching resume-weight paper and envelopes, and sign  your letter in black ink. If using stationery with a watermark, be sure it is facing the correct way.    Emailing Cover Letters and Resumes  Always follow an employers preference when emailing your resume and cover letter. If you dont know an  employers preference, send your resume and letter as attached PDFs labeled with your name (ex: Jane Doe  resume.). In the subject line say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResume and cover letter for childrens trade division editorial assistant  position (#498).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  If sending your letter as an attachment, make the email message short:  Dear Ms. Nunez:  I am a senior English major at Smith College with administrative and publications experience  interested in the childrens trade division editorial assistant position (#498) advertised on  bookjobs.com. The attached cover letter and resume provide details about my background and  strong interest in Cricket Hill Press.  Please let me know if you have difficulty opening the attachments. I look forward to discussing  this position with you.  Sincerely,  Jane Doe  Before emailing your documents to employers, email them to yourself and a couple of friends.

Suzan Smith  \\xe2\\x86\\x90 Note: You may use your resume header instead of this format.

Show youve  researched the organization, but dont recite facts and figures from their website. Connect what you know  about the organization to your experience and skills. Your goal is to show why you would be excited to have  this specific position at this specific organization.  Briefly state why the organizations mission, clients, programs, products, or services attract you. By now, the  recipient should clearly understand what youd add to the organization, and be convinced of your enthusiasm  for and match with the position.

Offer a next step: Will you call to arrange an in-person or phone interview? Will you  be in the area on a certain day and follow up to arrange a time to meet?

Sincerely,  Suzan Smith    8    SAMPLE RESUMES, COVER LETTERS, AND POSITION DESCRIPTIONS  A resume and cover letter should always work together as a team to respond to the specific skills and  qualifications sought in the position description.  For this reason, each sample resume-cover letter pair that follows is preceded by the corresponding job or  internship description.  We suggest you:  Review the descriptions and identify the keywords and field-specific terms in each.  Notice how each cover letter cites specific examples from the partner resume that show where  the match is between the applicant and the position, focusing on results and accomplishments.  Consider how the information on each resume, the categories chosen, and the language style  used respond to the specific wording of the companion description.

With strong  interests in youth development and team sports, I am drawn to this position as an opportunity to make a positive  difference in the lives of inner city youth.  I have extensive experience working with children in athletic and arts settings. As Assistant Coach of the Marion  County Youth Softball League, I designed non-competitive beginner practices that motivated each player to strive  for her personal best. As the girls skill level, self-esteem, and teamwork grew, several reported having greater  success in school. Previously, as Arts Leader for Fine Arts for Kids in Miami, I taught arts and crafts to Hispanic  youth and initiated cost-free activities that enriched their appreciation of art. As public schools are increasingly  cutting funding for arts and sports programs, I am eager to help close the gap for these children however I can.  As a teacher/coach with REAL Kids/Harlem RBI I hope to share with my students the important lessons about  teamwork, leadership, and motivation Ive learned from softball. I owe my academic success in large part to the  committed coaches I had since joining my first softball team at age six. I am excited by the prospect of inspiring  your students to play, learn, and grow this summer.  I am available at your convenience for an in-person or phone interview, and I look forward to hearing from you  soon.  Sincerely,  Emilia Renzi    11    EMILIA RENZI  erenzi@smith.edu  Smith College, 1 Chapin Way, Unit 0000, Northampton, MA 01063    (413) 585-1234    EDUCATION  Smith College, Northampton, MA  B.A. degree expected May 2019 Intended Major: Sociology  Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL  Graduated June 2015  Honors: National Honor Society (inducted as junior); Honor Roll (all 4 years)  Languages: Fluent Spanish  Computer Skills: MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint  LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE  Assistant Coach, Marion County Youth Softball League, Ocala, FL (Summers 2014 and 2015)   Co-planned and led twice-weekly practice sessions for 12 girls ages 10 and under including beginner players.

I would be excited to bring my experience in marketing,  background in music performance, and love of symphonic music to this opportunity.  As Marketing and Public Relations Manager for the Smith College a cappella group the  Smiffenpoofs, my marketing efforts and knowledge of the college-age audience achieved a  10% increase in concert ticket and CD sales last year. By taking courses in research and statistics  I have further built strengths in data collection and analysis.  I first experienced the power of live performance while attending The Philadelphia Orchestras  summer series at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in upstate New York where I grew up.  Wolfgang Sawallischs famed all-Wagner concerts and interpretations of the Bruckner  symphonies instilled in me a passion for music that continues to this day. The Marketing Intern  position interests me as an opportunity to contribute my marketing savvy and love of live  symphony while learning about the business side of the arts.  I welcome the opportunity to talk with you about my interest in The Philadelphia Orchestra  Association. I am available for a phone interview or I can meet in Philadelphia during my spring  break, March 14-18. I will follow up next week to see if we can arrange a convenient time to  speak.

The Investment Banking and Debt Capital Markets area exists to provide effective global \\'multi-product\\'  solutions for clients seeking to raise capital or manage their risk exposure.

This role involves  creative thinking, maintaining relationships, and providing the full range of the firm\\'s services to the client   government agencies or corporate clients looking to raise capital.  Generating new business is an important part of the role. It demands an understanding of complex products  and their pricing, as well as looking at issues from different angles and creating alternative ideas. Looking at  the bigger picture in terms of client needs and wider market issues is also important. As such, you may  spend your time developing ideas and solutions to pitch to clients. Following that, you may work on live deals  involving products such as bonds, equity and credit derivatives, securitization, loans, foreign exchange,  interest rates, and commodities.  Fundamental analysis and research into companies and markets is the starting point in Investment Banking  and Debt Capital Markets. This offers an opportunity to work with teams across the firm, delivering more  integrated solutions for our clients and across all areas of financing and risk management services.

At the September 28th information session at Amherst College I was struck by firstyear analyst Gregg Casales description of Barclays as a global team that prides itself on its ability to do  things differently while delivering exceptional financial solutions for clients. With my finance experience,  teamwork, and problem-solving skills, I believe I am well-paired to the analyst program and to Barclays  Capitals culture.  As a summer analyst at Morgan Stanley this past summer, I prepared pitch books and analyses for client  presentations and built financial models for leveraged buyouts and credit reviews. Through participating in  deal calls as part of the Financial Institutions Group team, I gained an understanding of how client needs are  best met under the pressure of time. Currently as treasurer of Smiths Student Government Association, I  administer financial transactions for 120+ student organizations and oversee a $500,000 budget,  responsibilities which draw on my attention to detail and ability to balance multiple priorities.  Im attracted to the firms practice of bringing together a flat hierarchy of diverse team members, each with  the opportunity to make a difference through creative problem solving, as this is how Ive discovered I work  best. Barclays Capitals commitment to service projects such as mentoring at-risk students and serving food  in local shelters appeals to me to given my volunteer experience with our local Big Sisters program. The  firms client-centered philosophy and global market position combined with the opportunity to contribute to  the community make Barclays Capital an exciting place to build my career.  I welcome the opportunity to talk with you about my qualifications, experience, and interest in the analyst  program at Barclays Capital. Thank you for your time and consideration.

The firms mission of strategizing with clients to be more relevant in peoples lives attracts me  because much of my work and academic experience has centered on researching and understanding society,  popular culture, and consumer decision-making.  Through conducting research for a new sociology department course on consumption in society, I learned about  the factors at play when a consumer makes a decision. One consumer may respond to experiencing a TV or  online ad, while those who skip over ads are more likely to be reached by embedded marketing. The fact that  CS SPACEs client roster includes organizations as prominent and wide-ranging as ESPN, Citi, Skype, and  Campbells speaks to your teams ability to deliver the insights clients need to develop their branding strategies  for greatest appeal to consumers.  An avid consumer and student of pop culture, I particularly enjoy trend spotting in music and sports, two of my  key pastimes. For a seminar paper I wrote for a course called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Sociology of Rock and Pop Music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I  conducted qualitative research on Y\\xc3\\xa9-Y\\xc3\\xa9 French pop music which I presented at a January 2016 conference at  Vassar College. With my study abroad experience in France and knowledge of other cultures, I believe I could  contribute inter-cultural insights of value to your team in working with your global clientele.  My understanding of consumer behavior goes beyond academic research to include front-line sales positions in  a busy resort area retail establishment and cold-calling alums for Smiths Office of Advancement. As a  phonathon caller my ability to develop rapport with alumnae, listen to their concerns, and track down  information they requested added to my success rate in obtaining pledges from those who had stopped giving  to Smith. I would bring to CS SPACE the same client focus along with a strong ability to research, analyze, and  synthesize data; keen organizational skills; and a work style that is both collaborative and independent.  I look forward to sharing a writing sample with you and learning more about your needs for the Junior Analyst  and Researcher position. I would be very excited to join the CS SPACE team, and I hope to hear from you soon.

Box 000, South Deerfield, MA 01373    (413) 000-0000    a.z.drew@gmail.com    February 20, 2016  Greer Diefenderfer  Employment Manager  Human Resources Department  Philadelphia Museum of Art  P.O. Box 7646  Philadelphia, PA 19101-7646    Dear Ms. Diefenderfer:  I am a graduating senior at Smith College writing to apply for the Press Relations Coordinator opportunity at  the Philadelphia Museum of Art posted February 16. I would bring to this position a demonstrated  commitment to the arts, strong public relations experience in arts non-profits, and proficiency with web and  publications design software.  Last summer as Marketing Intern for the Media Education Foundation, I led the development of MEFs social  media presence increasing attendance at our events by over 25%. At the same time, I developed press kits,  responded to press inquiries, and designed a brochure for distribution at film conferences. Because the MEF  offers resources designed to help spark discussion about some of the most pressing and complicated issues of  our time, I saw firsthand the challenge of educating the public about unfamiliar topics. As a Museums  Concentration student, I have learned that museums face similar challenges as they seek to attract an  increasingly diverse audience by engaging them with subject matter from different cultures and historical  periods.  Previously, as gallery assistant at the Firehouse Gallery in Vermont, I created a media and educational contact  database and designed an online press media list form  similar to that in your electronic press room  using  Dreamweaver. As a result, event attendance increased from previous years. As an intern in Smiths  advancement office I initiated an alumnae database that proved valuable to other campus departments outreach  to alums, while in the alumnae relations office, I answered daily email and phone inquiries, sent blast emails, and  coordinated mailings, often under a tight deadline.  The Press Relations Coordinator position particularly attracts me because it combines my passions for public  relations and the arts with my communication skills and talents in design and media.

{"id": 289, "text": "\"Resumes    for Engineers    What is a resume?  A resume is a marketing brochure about you. It describes your skills, experience (paid and/or unpaid), and your  education. The purpose of an effective resume is to get you an interview.  Is one resume good for all jobs?  Your job search materials should be customized for each position. If your search is focused on one type of  position, a single version of your resume may be fine, along with a cover letter that is tailored to your  employment target. If youre applying to a wider range of positions, you may need to revise your resume in  addition to creating a new cover letter. This customization is essential to your marketing and requires research  about the organization and industry.  What is a chronological resume?  The chronological resume is a commonly used format for undergraduate students. The experience section of a  chronological resume includes your positions, listed in reverse chronological order (beginning with your most  recent position and working backwards). Essential data includes: name of organization, location, your title, and  dates of employment/involvement. This is followed by several bullets, describing your skills and achievements.  How is an engineering resume different than a liberal arts resume?  An engineering resume may include specialized section headings such as:  Technical Skills  Engineering Experience    Lab Experience  Academic Experience    Lab Skills  Research    Relevant Courses  Projects or Design Projects    An engineer often includes academic work including a list of courses and relevant project work. This academic  experience might be listed before work experience, if they have not yet interned or worked in an engineering  environment. Technical skills may also be listed at the top of the resume if required by the position.  What else do I need to know about resumes?  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Survive the human scan. Resumes get less than 30 seconds of an employer's time.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Survive the electronic scan. Make sure you have used appropriate jargon and keywords for your field.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Capture your readers attention by keeping your resume to a single, easily \\xe2\\x80\\x98skimmable page. Check  with a Career Advisor about exceptions to the one-page rule.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Use good quality paper in colors such as white, off-white or neutral if submitting hard copy.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Check for typos, spelling errors, and grammar usage.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Include a customized cover letter that demonstrates how you match the employers requirements.  How do I email my resume?  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Email your resume and cover letter as one attachment (PDF format with your cover letter as page 1  and resume as page 2).  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f When emailing your documents to employers, include your first initial and last name in the title of the  document. When creating an appropriate subject line for your email, use your name and the position  to which youre applying. For example: Civil engineering intern application from J. Barnum.  \\xc2\\xb7 Include a short note in your email message to briefly introduce yourself, list the position to which you are  applying, and indicate that you have attached your application to the email and look forward to  connecting with the employer to discuss your skills and experiences.    ~Please use Resume Checklist on following page to prepare your document~  Tufts Career Center | careers.tufts.edu | 617.627.3299 | Dowling Hall 740    Tufts Career Center | careers.tufts.edu | 617.627.3299 | Dowling Hall 740    RESUME CHECKLIST  FORMATTING & MECHANICS  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r    Document fits on one page without overcrowding.

{"id": 296, "text": "\"Resumes    for Engineers    What is a resume?  A resume is a marketing brochure about you. It describes your skills, experience (paid and/or unpaid), and your  education. The purpose of an effective resume is to get you an interview.  Is one resume good for all jobs?  Your job search materials should be customized for each position. If your search is focused on one type of  position, a single version of your resume may be fine, along with a cover letter that is tailored to your  employment target. If youre applying to a wider range of positions, you may need to revise your resume in  addition to creating a new cover letter. This customization is essential to your marketing and requires research  about the organization and industry.  What is a chronological resume?  The chronological resume is a commonly used format for undergraduate students. The experience section of a  chronological resume includes your positions, listed in reverse chronological order (beginning with your most  recent position and working backwards). Essential data includes: name of organization, location, your title, and  dates of employment/involvement. This is followed by several bullets, describing your skills and achievements.  How is an engineering resume different than a liberal arts resume?  An engineering resume may include specialized section headings such as:  Technical Skills  Engineering Experience    Lab Experience  Academic Experience    Lab Skills  Research    Relevant Courses  Projects or Design Projects    An engineer often includes academic work including a list of courses and relevant project work. This academic  experience might be listed before work experience, if they have not yet interned or worked in an engineering  environment. Technical skills may also be listed at the top of the resume if required by the position.  What else do I need to know about resumes?  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Survive the human scan. Resumes get less than 30 seconds of an employer's time.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Survive the electronic scan. Make sure you have used appropriate jargon and keywords for your field.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Capture your readers attention by keeping your resume to a single, easily \\xe2\\x80\\x98skimmable page. Check  with a Career Advisor about exceptions to the one-page rule.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Use good quality paper in colors such as white, off-white or neutral if submitting hard copy.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Check for typos, spelling errors, and grammar usage.  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Include a customized cover letter that demonstrates how you match the employers requirements.  How do I email my resume?  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f Email your resume and cover letter as one attachment (PDF format with your cover letter as page 1  and resume as page 2).  \\xe2\\x97\\x8f When emailing your documents to employers, include your first initial and last name in the title of the  document. When creating an appropriate subject line for your email, use your name and the position  to which youre applying. For example: Civil engineering intern application from J. Barnum.  \\xc2\\xb7 Include a short note in your email message to briefly introduce yourself, list the position to which you are  applying, and indicate that you have attached your application to the email and look forward to  connecting with the employer to discuss your skills and experiences.    ~Please use Resume Checklist on following page to prepare your document~  Tufts Career Center | careers.tufts.edu | 617.627.3299 | Dowling Hall 740    Tufts Career Center | careers.tufts.edu | 617.627.3299 | Dowling Hall 740    RESUME CHECKLIST  FORMATTING & MECHANICS  r  r  r  r  r  r  r  r    Document fits on one page without overcrowding.

{"id": 297, "text": "\"HOW TO WRITE A PROFESSIONAL RESUME    RESUME TIPS  The following tips are suggestions that you should consider when writing and sending your resume to prospective  employers:            Use white or light colored paper in standard size (8 \\xc2\\xbd x 11 inches). Many office supply stores sell resume paper.  Be sure to include a cover letter with mailed and emailed resumes. When you email a resume and cover letter,  create a short introduction to use as your email body.  The resume should be easy to read, crisp, and have a consistent format.  Always keep your resume up-to-date!    Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which scan resumes for key words and themes that  match the job description. These words identify skills that the company is looking for to fill specific job postings. However,  due to the use of this software, there are specific ways a resume should be formatted so that it will scan properly in to the  companys system.            Do not use a template, invisible text boxes, special graphics, color, or shading. Always use a blank Microsoft Word  document to create a text-only version of your resume for online submissions. Always submit your resume in a .pdf  format and save more creative versions of your resume to hand to an employer in person.  Use standard, non-decorative fonts in black ink only. Font sizes should be 14-16pt for your name and 10-12pt for  the body of your resume.  Margins should be equally set between .6  1 inch on all sides.  Avoid folding or stapling your resume. If your resume is more than one page, create a header and/or footer with  your name, contact information, and page number.    Key words describe skills using nouns and action verbs and are very important in your resume. Companies usually  indicate key skills they are looking for in the job posting.          Use synonyms in your resume  if you use the word, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAttorney\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, also use the word, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLawyer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Do not use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, or other personal pronouns  simply begin statements with strong action verbs to  describe what you did.  Key words = experience + knowledge (be honest and do not exaggerate your skills).    Always proofread your resume before you send it!    OBJECTIVES  An objective statement is a one or two line statement of your career or job search goal. It is used in place of a longer  summary, likely when a candidate has little to no experience related to their target position. Your objective should be  specific to the type of position or field that youre applying to and focus on what you can contribute to the position or  company, not what you want or what you can gain from the experience.

RELEVANT COURSES  The Relevant Courses section should be used on the resume when you need to demonstrate your knowledge of the  industry when you have little to no relevant work experience. Choose your most impressive courses; try to avoid listing the  entry-level ones.  This section is best paired with the Academic Projects section. Together, both sections are an excellent way to utilize your  degree for your job goal.  To format the section, simply list your classes using multiple columns. Course numbers, descriptions, and grades are not  necessary.  NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY  DO NOT COPY.    TWO COLUMN SAMPLE:  RELEVANT COURSES  Financial Accounting  Calculus  Macroeconomics    Management Accounting  Business Finance  Organizational Development    THREE COLUMN SAMPLE:  RELEVANT COURSES  Digital Circuits  Hardware Modeling  VLSI Design    Information Security  Advanced Systems  Numerical Analysis    Digital Logic  Computer Graphics  Automata Theory    ACADEMIC PROJECTS  Academic projects are used to demonstrate your knowledge of an area or industry when you have little or no experience.  Anything done in class, except tests, can be presented as a project. Examples include presentations, papers, group work,  case studies, and research.  All academic projects should be written in active voice using the strongest action verbs possible. In this suggested format,  include a title and keep the overview to two to three lines, providing only enough information so the prospective employer  can ask questions. If the project is too in-depth to present in two or three lines, use two or three bulleted statements instead  of the paragraph format.  NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY  DO NOT COPY.    Software Engineering Group Project  Designed library catalog web system using 3-tier, client-server model.

Ensured  measurement and layout accuracy through careful architectural research.    RESULT/ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENTS  Result and accomplishment statements are used when describing previous experience to show the employer written proof  of your results, achievements, and successes. They demonstrate what is unique about you and how you can add value to a  potential position by citing specific examples. Simply listing duties or responsibilities from your job description are not  enough  focus on what you actually did and how your efforts impacted your position, the project, or organization.  To help get you in the mindset of writing result and accomplishment statements, ask yourself some of these questions:   What was the purpose of this work? How was this work relevant to the organization?   What goals was I contributing to? What value or benefit did I add?   How did I go above and beyond basic job duties? Compared to others in my position, how did I stand out?   Did this work save time/money, increase customer satisfaction, design/improve a process or policy, etc? Did I  achieve more with less; complete something ahead of schedule/budget?   Did I receive a promotion and/or recognition during my employment? Did I consistently maintain or hit above  personal or company goals or quotas?  NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY  DO NOT COPY.    You can develop result and accomplishment statements using several methods, which are described below:  SOAR  Statement of Action  What did you do? (Action verb)  Occurrence of Action  How often action occurred/took place (daily, weekly, annually, etc.)  Amount of Action  How much, how many? (20%, 50+, over 100, $1M, etc.)  Result of Action  Result/outcome of efforts (increased, decreased, designed, saved, implemented, etc.)  Statement  Managed a technical crew  Occurrence  Managed a technical crew on a daily basis  Amount  Managed a technical crew of over 20 people on a daily basis  Result  Managed a technical crew of over 20 people, on a daily basis, that increased production 3 quarters in a row  PAR/CAR  Problem/Challenge  Problem/challenge/opportunity  Action  Action taken to solve the problem  Result  Result or outcome of your efforts    STAR  Situation/Task  Situation or task at hand  Action  Action taken  Result  Result of action taken    ADDITIONAL RESULT/ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENT EXAMPLES:   Selected as Freshman Orientation Leader; acclimated 150 new students to college environment through guided  tours of campus and presentations over a 3-day period.

TRANSFERABLE SKILLS  You have obtained many skills throughout your life: working, being a student, participating in extracurricular activities, and  even personal experiences have all contributed to your skill set. Skills which can apply to many different jobs or areas are  called transferable skills. They are especially handy to use if you have no relevant work experience or if you are changing  career paths. Incorporating these into your work experience section will help showcase the applicable skills you have to  offer the employer. Remember, simply listing that you have these skills is not enough. You must include how you used  these skills in order to prove you possess them, and show how they are relevant and applicable to the employer.  Below is a list of transferable skills to help you get started.  Communication  Speaking effectively  Listening attentively  Writing concisely  Editing    Providing appropriate feedback  Perceiving nonverbal messages  Facilitating group discussion  Expressing ideas    Negotiating and persuading  Speaking a foreign language  Reporting information  Describing feelings    Research and Planning  Creating ideas  Setting goals  Forecasting  Analyzing    Extracting information  Identifying resources  Developing strategies  Predicting outcomes    Gathering information  Synthesizing data  Solving problems  Defining needs    Human Relations  Developing rapport  Being sensitive  Counseling  Asserting    Perceiving feelings and situations  Providing support for others  Delegating with respect  Conveying feelings    Representing others  Cooperating  Motivating  Listening    Organization, Management, and Leadership  Initiating new ideas  Decision making with others  Managing groups  Delegating responsibility  Managing conflict  Selling ideas or products  Coaching  Handling details    Coordinating tasks  Promoting change  Counseling  Teaching    Work Survival  Being punctual  Meeting goals  Cooperating  Organizing    Attending to detail  Enforcing policies  Making decisions  Enlisting help    Setting and meeting deadlines  Implementing decisions  Accepting responsibility  Managing time    TRANSFERABLE SKILLS: SAMPLES  Here are some examples of how to use transferable skills to improve on basic job descriptions and prove to the employer  that you possess relevant job-related skills.

ACTION VERBS  When describing a current job or project, use these verbs; if you are describing a past job or project, make sure to change  these verbs into their past-tense endings.  Bolded words are especially good for describing accomplishments.

{"id": 301, "text": "\"your resume and try to determine if they have a position that would work for you. An objective statement that  says you want a position that offers growth and advancement and the opportunity to expand on your education  and training tells an employer that you are looking for what they can do for you, not what you can do for them.    EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE...What to put first  If your education is more pertinent to the work you are seeking than your employment history, list your  education first. If your education is very pertinent to the job, you may wish to list specific course titles that you  have completed that are directly related to the work you would be doing. If your employment history is more  pertinent, it should be listed first on your resume.    ACADEMIC BACKGROUND  Your academic background should be included in the resume with your most recently obtained degree or most  advanced degree listed first. The usual method is to list the school name, city and state, degree earned and date  of graduation. If you are currently enrolled in school, you can list your projected date of graduation.  If you have received \\xe2\\x80\\x9chonors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at school, were elected class president, or supported yourself through college you  can add those achievements to your resume under a heading such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonors and Achievements.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  If you feel that some of your coursework will be valuable to you on the job, you may want a heading called  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMajor Coursework\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPertinent Coursework\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where you would list specific classes by name. If the name of  the course does not make it obvious what the content of the course was, you may want to add this information in  parentheses.    OTHER POSSIBLE TOPIC OR SKILL HEADINGS  Equipment  Computer Expertise  Qualifications Highlights/Summary    Language Competency  Licenses/Certificates  Additional Training  Professional Affiliations  Strengths/Accomplishments/Achievements    REFERENCES  There are mixed opinions as to whether or not to have a references notation on your resume. If you are  squeezed for space, it is probably in your best interest to use the space to sell yourself to the employer. On the  other hand, if you are just starting out in the job market, there is no harm in noting that you do have references  available on your resume. You should have references available to hand to the employer immediately, and may  want to include them with your resume as part of your application packet.  References are usually the last heading on your resume, and are usually listed as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvailable upon Request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences Attached, Additional References Available Upon Request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences and Portfolio Available  Upon Request.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Be sure that you have them typed and ready to hand out. References should not be listed  individually on the resume itself, but rather on a separate sheet, with an indication as to your relationship to the  person you are listing as a reference. For work related references you might list company presidents, managers,  supervisors, co-workers, or clients. Personal references can include friends, faculty, landlords, etc. Providing a  list of references works as long as a reference is still available at your prior employer. A letter of  recommendation gives you a hedge against the day that your reference moves on and you can no longer refer  potential employers to them.  Be sure that you ask a person if they are willing to be a reference for you before you list them as a reference.  Check with your listed references regularly to be sure that they are still available.  4    LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION  If possible, get a written letter of recommendation from as many people as possible before you leave a job or  soon afterwards. A written recommendation is a known quantity. You can never be sure what someone says  about you in a verbal recommendation. Written letters of recommendation may be attached to a resume, or  given to a potential employer separately with your references. A letter of recommendation can speak about you  in more glowing terms than you would feel comfortable describing yourself. Many employers want to speak to  a reference rather than read a letter of recommendation. They distrust letters of recommendation, knowing that  you would be unlikely to provide a less than glowing one, and want to talk to your reference directly, or even  circumvent your listed references and speak to other people who may have worked with you at the company.  Always check with your references before listing them on an application to be sure that they are still available  and willing to act as a reference for you. If you are uneasy about what your references may be saying about  you, you can hire a reference checking service, or have a friend act as a potential employer and call the  reference you are concerned about. If you choose to go this route, give them a script to work from. Many  companies have a reference policy and will only verify that you were an employee and the dates that you  worked for that company.    WHAT NOT TO PUT IN YOUR RESUME  Do not put your age, sex, marital status, number of children, religious affiliation, ethnic origin, height, weight or  health status. This information may be used to discriminate against you, and is illegal for employers to ask  prior to hiring you. It is also advisable not to list political or professional affiliations unless they are directly job  related.  Do not include past salaries or anticipated starting salary. This information may be requested by an employer,  however the consensus with employment professionals is that it is not in your best interest to include the  information in writing. You have to choose whether or not you feel you background is strong enough that they  will want to speak to you without this information. If you include a section of hobbies or extracurricular  activities, it is recommended that you leave out any activities that could be considered physically hazardous.  Employers want you on the job, not recovering from your recreational activities.    REMEMBER  Your resume should be free of spelling, grammatical and typographical errors. Have it proof read. Never  assume that a computer spell check will find all errors. Keep it simple. Do not use brightly colored paper or a  variety of graphics or fonts or font sizes.  Have your resume printed on good quality, rag bond paper. Have you references list and letters of  recommendation and cover letter printed on the same paper as your resume. If possible, avoid plain white  paper.  If your resume will be scanned (not a usual occurrence in Santa Cruz, but common in Silicon Valley), be sure to  provide a scanner friendly version.  If you are doing a web based resume, be sure any links to or from that web link are professional. Do not post  your picture on-line as part of your on-line resume.  Do not send out a resume that has cross outs or things handwritten in. Take the time to do it right.  5    KEY WORDS FOR RESUME PREPARATION  Ability  Accelerated  Accomplished  Accurate  Achieved  Active  Adapted  Adjusted  Administer  Advertised  Advised  Aggressive

Check  out her or his name, title and honorarium (Dr., Mr., Ms., Miss., or Mrs.). You can usually get this information  from the business switchboard operator or receptionist. Be sure that you have the spelling right. The only time  that you would send a letter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo Whom It May Concern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would be if you were responding to an advertisement  with a blind post office box.  Although personnel / human resources offices sometimes handle initial screening of job applicants, send your  resume and cover letter to the person you would be working for. If you are applying to a large company,  offering similar career opportunities in more that one department, send a letter and resume to each department  head. In this instance you would want to keep your career objective statement flexible, but not so flexible that  they are not sure about the position you are seeking. Do not expect to receive a response if the company is not  currently advertising a position.  FOR MORE HELP...

It only takes a few moments to write a  thank you note and the results can be rewarding.  The note should be brief; thank them for their time and consideration in seeing you and reiterate your interest  in the position. Emphasize what you can do for them, not what they can do for you.  A thank you note shows that you are considerate. It may put you ahead of the competition, or keep your name  fresh in the employers\\' mind for future consideration.  Be sure your follow-up note has your contact information on the note itself, not just on the envelope.    SAMPLE FOLLOW UP LETTER  October 15, 2004  Ms. Jennifer Jones  District Manager  Bank of Central California  1212 Spring Street  San Luis Obispo, CA 95555  Dear Ms. Jones,  Thank you for taking the time to thoroughly discuss your management training program with me yesterday  during the course of my interview.

I am excited by the opportunity to be affiliated with the Bank of Central California during the bank\\'s growth  into the arena of international banking and would be willing to continue my education in the area of  international business if considered for this position.  I enjoyed the opportunity to meet with you and I appreciate the time you spent with me. I hope to hear from  you soon.  Sincerely,  Ellen James  1912 Cedar Street  Santa Cruz, CA 95060  831-XXX-XXXX    28    SCANNABLE RESUMES  The key points to remember in creating a resume that will translate well when processed through a scanner  for selection are SIMPLICITY & TERMINOLOGY.  Scanners look for key words when sorting resumes into employment categories and awarding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoints\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for  consideration. Many of the things that are important in a resume that is being reviewed by a person, will work  against you when a resume is being scanned by a machine. If you are sending resumes to companies that use  scanners, and companies that do not use scanners, you will need two styles of resume. You may also want to  send both styles of resume to the same company, with an indication that one is for scanning and the other for  the hiring manager to read.  SIMPLICITY : Use plain text only. Do not use italics , bold face, or underlines. (See resume on page 21)  Do not use shading, borders, graphics or bullets. Use a font that is 11-14 points and is simple and easy to read  such as CG Times, Palatino, Bookman, etc.  Be sure that your name is on the top line by itself. Print the resume on a laser printer if possible and send a  crisp, clean copy on white paper. Use white space. Scanners recognize that white spaces separate categories.  TERMINOLOGY - Scanners search for key words. Use nouns rather than verbs, Words like systems  engineering, accounting, public relations, IBM, manager, etc., The more you can use appropriate terminology,  the more points you accumulate. With the exception of common abbreviations such as IBM or B.A.,  (Bachelor of Arts), you will want to minimize the use of abbreviations, and be sure to use words that have a  common definition.  Scanners are designed to look for key words which describe job titles, functions, skills, academic degrees,  relevant training, equipment, computer hardware and software, technical and industry jargon, and relevant  personality traits.  A one page resume is no longer the rule for scannable resumes. You can many times re-work your existing  resume by eliminating the fancy graphics and adding a key word section at the end of the resume. Include  all of the job specific words that apply to either your education, experience or the job qualifications which you  meet.  One of the major distributors of resume scanning technology is a company called Resumix  (http://www.resumix.com/). They offer a site that allows you to create an on-line resume  (http://www.resumix.com/mwb/resume-form.html). There are many other resume creation sites also available on  the internet.  POSTING YOUR RESUME ON-LINE  Submitting your resume to an on-line job referral service can be as easy as sending an email. Some sites want  you to follow their format and fill in boxes on an e-form, some allow you to cut and paste from a word document.  Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, HotJobs.com, CALJobs.ca.gov and additional sites listed on Hot Jobs Links on  our Cabrillo College Student Employment web site are all potential sites for you to post your resume on-line.  Some sites offer \"\"push technology\"\" where you can post your e-mail address and have jobs that meet your stated  criteria sent to you as they are listed.  29    WEB RESUMES  Anyone can have a web resume if they have access to a web site, although they are more common for people  with technical expertise or artistic abilities. Posting your resume on-line gives you the ability to appear to be  technologically savvy, but also provides a window for anyone with a good search engine to get more  information about you than you might like to provide. You may not want to post your address or land line  phone on an web resume.  In a web resume, you can provide copies of letters of recommendation, links to projects that you have done on  the web, show off a portfolio of art work, and have your resume available to anyone at anytime. Web  Resumes allow you to expand on a simple paper resume and creative side. Be sure not to include a picture of  yourself as part of this resume.    E-MAILING YOUR RESUME  When e-mailing your resume to an employer it is a good idea to give them the option as to how they would  like to view your resume. You can send it as a word attachment, but it is also a good idea to include it as plain  text in the body of your e-mail to the employer. Not every one feels comfortable accepting attachments due to  the potential for virus contamination. When sending an ASCII resume, be sure to send it to a couple of  friends who use different browsers, as it may not look the same when received as it did when you sent it.  Have your friends print you a copy so that you can come up with a version to e-mail that will have a good  readable layout when received.  FINAL TIPS  Focus the resume on the job you are applying for. Think what you can do for the employer. Which  of your skills are the most applicable for the job you are applying for.  Start with what will sell you best to the employer. If your education is more relevant than your  work history, lead with your education. If your work history is more relevant, lead with that. If you  have acquired skills from other venues that are your greatest strengths, lead with a summary of those  skills.  Use strong terminology. Key words, action words and strong phrasing are very important.  Keep it honest. Do not embellish your background with degrees you have not earned or job titles that  you have not held.  Make it easy to read, with no errors. Use white space appropriately. Have it proof read by several  different people before printing your final draft. Listen to suggestions, but realize that there is no one  best way to do a resume, and that only you can make the final decision as to how to market yourself on  paper to a prospective employer.  30\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}
{"id": 302, "text": "\"RESUMES/COVER LETTERS  RESUMES    A resume is a brief summary of your qualifications, education, and experiences relevant to your job search objective.  The purpose of a resume is to obtain an interview. Employers will spend less than 30 seconds reviewing your resume;  therefore, the information must be conveyed in a clear, well-organized style. The sections of a resume are listed below.    Your Name  Email address  Phone number  Current Address \\t  Web page and/or LinkedIn address (if pertinent)  Objective  This section is optional. The objective can include the specific position  you are seeking, skills you wish to use on the job, field or organization  type by which you wish to be employed, or a combination of all of the  above.

See  Sample Action Verb list on the next page.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Do try quantifying results in your descriptions, such as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCreated marketing campaign that increased club membership  by 25%.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Do keep your resume brief enough to fit on one page (or two  pages if your experience is extensive).  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Do print your resume on good quality bond paper, either white  or conservative tones. If printed on plain computer paper, copy  onto good quality bond paper.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Do accompany your resume with a cover letter in most cases.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Do have others look over your resume for content and  grammar. Career Counselors are available at the CDC to  critique your resume during same day appointments.    Donts    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Dont make your margins and font size too small: margins no  smaller than one inch and font size no smaller than 10 point.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Dont include personal pronouns (e.g. I, me, we).  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Dont include personal information, physical characteristics, or  photographs on your resume. However, individuals from other  countries may include these on their resumes.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Dont include the last line: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences available upon  request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (see Sample Reference List on page 42).    Other Tips    RESUME FORMATS    There is no single way to format your resume. The format you  choose should present your strengths clearly. See sample formats  and layouts on pages 27 - 41.    Chronological Format    This format is most familiar to employers and most commonly  used by Stanford students. This style of resume presents your  experience and education in reverse chronological sequence,  starting with the most recent. Date, job title, organizations name,  location and a description of your activities are listed as part of  the experience section. This format is simple, straightforward,  and especially useful for anyone with a history of directly relevant  experience.    Functional/Skills Format    This format focuses on areas of skill and can be effective in  conveying your strengths to an employer, although many employers  are not as familiar with this format as with the chronological  or combination format. This style of resume draws attention to    Combination Format  This format is appropriate when you have relevant work  experience for each of several skill areas and combines both the  chronological and functional formats. This style allows you to group  your experiences or key selling points together by functional areas  (such as Research Experience and Teaching Experience), and then  list those experiences in reverse chronological order within each  section. It is also a familiar format to employers.    SUBMITTING RESUMES  ELECTRONICALLY  Email    Send your resume as an attached file and paste the text into the  body of the email. Having your resume in the body of the email as  well as an attachment gives the employer the opportunity to see  your resume in the event they cannot open your attachment or do  not take the time. Use a simple format for the resume you put in the  body of the email: left justified, no bold, no italics, no underlines,  no tabs. See Sample Electronic Resume on page 42. Dont forget to  include a cover letter in the body of the email too. If you have your  resume in a PDF file, you can also attach that with your email. The  PDF version will allow the employer the opportunity to see your  resume in an attractive format, utilizing bold and underlines.  When emailing resume files, name them so the employer can  easily identify them as your resume. Last name, followed by first  name and the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresume\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is most helpful.    Resume Scanning  Companies receiving large quantities of resumes may scan each  resume as an image, and then sort the image into recognizable  letters, words, and symbols. These scanned images are entered  into a database and then searched for keywords, which indicate  skills, education and knowledge areas the employer is seeking.  Left-justify all text and avoid using underlining, italics, bullets, bold,  and columns.  Every occupation and career field has its own jargon, acronyms  and buzzwords\\xe2\\x80\\x94these are helpful key words to use. If you are  responding to a job listing, use words from the job listing in your  resume and cover letter.

However, important high school  experiences that have some relevance to your job objective  may be appropriate for upper classmen.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07For International Students it is sometimes a disadvantage to  include your non-immigrant visa status or permanent address  (if outside the U.S.) on your resume. Usually your visa status  should be discussed later during the interview.

COVER LETTERS    The cover letter provides you with an opportunity to introduce yourself and state your objective, personalize  your resume, and highlight information that addresses the needs and interests of the employer. Bear in mind  that letters you write not only convey your interest and qualifications, but also give the employer an opportunity  to observe your attentiveness to detail, spelling, grammar, and the overall quality of your written communication.  Flaws in your letters will often be interpreted as flaws in your qualifications.    Address  City, ST Zip Code  Date  Name  Title  Company/Organization Name  Address  City, ST Zip Code  Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name:  Opening Paragraph:  What is your intent in writing this letter? What position are you  applying for and how did you learn about it?  Briefly introduce yourself, your major, and the degree anticipated.  If you are aware of a specific opening, refer to it. If you are not  aware of a specific position, state your area of interest. This  paragraph can also be used to refer to the individual who  recommended that you contact the organization, or other factors  that prompted you to write. If possible, convey why you are  interested in the organization and anything you know about their  product or service.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 \\x07Resumes are only as good as the  letter accompanying them. So  make sure that you spend some  time on your letter and direct it to  the appropriate person.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 \\x07What you write and how you write  it tells potential employers a great  deal about your professionalism,  competence, and personality.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 \\x07In a job search aimed at business and professional circles,  proper procedures and communication etiquette are important.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 \\x07A cover letter should entice an  employer to want to take action  on your resume. It should  persuade the employer to invite  you for a job interview.    Third Paragraph:  What is your plan of action? Do you want to follow up with a phone call or do you want them to contact  you?  Close your letter by stating that you would like to discuss employment opportunities or other information  with the individual and that you will call to follow up on your letter. This demonstrates your initiative and  follow-through and will help you maintain some control of your efforts.  Other points that can be made in the last paragraph:  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 Express your willingness to provide additional information  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 State a specific time when you will follow up by phone or email  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 Let them know if and when you are going to visit their area  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82 Thank the person receiving your letter for their time and interest  Most importantly, remember to address the cover letter to a person. If you do not have a name, call the  department or human resources to find out to whom your letter should be addressed. As a last resort,  address your letter to the personnel manager, hiring manager, or recruiting representative.    studentaffairs.stanford.edu/cdc\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\xe2\\x80\\x82 4 3    RESUMES/COVER LETTERS    Second Paragraph:  What are your qualifications? Why do you want to work for this organization? What would you enjoy  doing for them? Sell yourself and be brief. Whet the employers appetite so that he/she will want to read  your resume and schedule an interview.  Describe highlights from your background that would be of greatest interest to the organization. Focus on  skills, activities, accomplishments, and past experience you can contribute to the organization and its work.  If possible, demonstrate that you know something about the organization and industry/field. Use action  verbs that describe relevant skills and expertise you can contribute. Mention specific knowledge you may  have such as computer applications, foreign languages, lab techniques, writing and editing capabilities.  You are attempting to create a match or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnotion of fit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between the employers hiring needs and your  interests, experience, and skills.    RESUMES/COVER LETTERS    TIPS FOR CREATING AN EFFECTIVE  COVER LETTER    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Collect your thoughts. Your ideas may not come out logically or  sequentially, but write them down. Dont judge and evaluate,  simply collect them.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x82\\x07Spend time on your letter.

{"id": 308, "text": "\"RESUME WRITING  Tips for resume formatting and content, with samples from alumni  A resume is a brief, concise document that presents, and effectively sells, your most relevant and positive credentials for  employment, admission to graduate school, consideration for a scholarship or fellowship, or other professional purpose.  An employer will usually spend 15 to 30 seconds reviewing your resume, so the content of your resume must be clear,  concise, and targeted to the type of job for which you are applying.    Preparation  Resumes should highlight skills and accomplishments that meet employer qualifications, excluding irrelevant  information and experiences. Well-designed resumes will be visually appealing and free from any spelling, typographical,  punctuation, or grammatical errors. All resumes should be written concisely in an organized format that presents the  most important information first.  Employers who read individual resumes spend very little time on each resume. Many large employers now use software  programs (Applicant Tracking Systems) to assist them with this initial review.  If your resume has a typo or grammatical error, it will probably jump off the page to an employer, and this is a way to  weed you out of a candidate pool. Your resume may be the only chance you get to make an impression, so make it a  good one.    Constructing Your Resume  Contact information  Begin your resume with your name by capitalizing and using bold type.   Include street address, city, state, and zip code.   Include a phone number(s) where you can be reached.   Include your e-mail address.  Objective (Optional)  The purpose of the objective statement is to inform the employer of your career goals and targeted interests. Objectives  are no longer as widely used as they once were, as employers expect you to cover the same information in more detail  in the cover letter. If you would like to include an objective, review the samples on the last page of this handout.  A career/job objective may be advantageous when:   You want to specify your interests and where you would fit in the organization.   You want to present the impression of a focused, self-confident person.  A career/job objective is not advantageous when it is:   Too broad and meaningless, reflecting indecision.   Too exclusive, eliminating you from jobs for which you might be considered.  Qualifications or Experience Summary (Optional)  A summary of qualifications can condense an extensive background by emphasizing experiences and accomplishments  in brief keyword phrases. The qualifications summary is accomplishment-oriented and provides an overview of your  work experience. It can also serve to summarize relevant academic, volunteer and leadership experience for those who  have limited work experience. A summary is most appropriate for someone with substantial experience, someone who  is changing careers and wants to demonstrate transferable skills, or someone with a varied background. Theyre most  often used by graduate students and working professionals.    Education  If your education relates to your objective and is within the past three years, it should be the first section. If not,  education should follow the work experience section of your resume.  In reverse-chronological order, this section includes the schools you have attended, dates of graduation or dates of  attendance, as well as degrees sought or completed. Other information that might be included: related coursework,  scholarships and honors, and special projects (e.g. research projects, teaching).   Start with your most recent degree or the program in which you are currently enrolled. List other degrees or  relevant education in reverse chronological order.   Highlight key info by using bold type or capital letters.   Most students begin with the university, followed by the location, degree, and graduation date. You can consider  listing your degree before the name of the university as well.   Should I include my GPA? If you are uncertain about including your GPA, ask a Career Services advisor for  recommendations based on your individual circumstances.  Within this section, you may also want to highlight coursework, research, or a study abroad experience.   Consider listing relevant coursework under the appropriate degree.   You may want to describe thesis, research or design projects (Note: You may want to have a separate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRelated  Course Projects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section  see examples in this handout).  Chronological Format  In the chronological resume, job history is organized chronologically with the most recent job listed first. Job titles and  employers are emphasized and duties and accomplishments are described in detail.   Begin with your current/most recent position and work backward, chronologically.   Devote more space to relevant employment/experiences.   If your job titles relate to your current job objective, start each position description with job titles. If not, begin  with the organization.   Follow job title and organizational information with the organization\\'s city and state.   Use the first and last month (or semester terms, such as Fall, Spring, and Summer) and year to describe dates of  employment.   Describe experiences related to the position youre applying for in detail. Summarize earlier positions unless  relevant to your objective. Within each listed position, stress the major accomplishments and responsibilities that  demonstrate your competency    Resume Checklist  The following checklist has been designed to assist you in writing your resume. This checklist reflects the expertise of the  Career Center staff developed through critiquing thousands of resumes, discussing selection criteria with numerous  employers, and gathering input from a wide range of career professionals.  Appearance   Is it inviting and easy to read; not too much information uses appropriate font styles (sans serif fonts are often  recommended but the serif font Times New Roman is accepted) and font sizes (10-12 pts.)   Incorporates enough white space between sections to facilitate skimming; adequate margins creates visual impact  (minimum is .5in on all four sides); using bullets; boldface, italics, and font sizes to emphasize key words (for  scannable resumes, use boldface only)  Organization and Format   Presents strongest qualifications first   Appropriate length: For most cases, one page for undergraduates, more for those with advanced degrees for  several years of post-grad work experience (2-3 pages)  Writing Style   Begins phrases with powerful action verbs              Short bullets (1-2 lines) with 2-6 bullets per experience (depending on how related it is to the opportunity you  seek); you can list an experience without listing bullets if you want the employer to know about your involvement  but its not directly related to the position  Brief, succinct language; no unnecessary words  Absolutely free from grammatical, spelling, punctuation, usage, and typographical errors    CONTENT:  Contact Information   Address, current and permanent (if necessary  otherwise just choose one)   Telephone number  Objective (Optional)   Briefly indicates the sort of position, title, and possible area of specialization sought   For management or supervisory positions, indicates level of responsibility sought   Language is specific, employer centered not self-centered; avoids broad or vague statements  Summary of Skills, Accomplishments, or Expertise (Optional)   Identifies 3-6 key achievements that support the objective   Summarizes relevant work experience and accomplishments that support the objective  Education   Highest level of attainment is listed first; work from most current degree backward degree in progress or most  recently completed degree; include name of university, location of university, type of degree and major, date of  graduation, list of other degrees, relevant higher education coursework, continuing professional education or  training   Courses, and study abroad   Second major, minor, or areas of concentration   Omit high school if you have completed more than two years of college unless referencing impressive honors or  relevant extracurricular activities   Relevant courses, papers, projects; include paper or project titles   GPA, honors, awards, scholarships  Employment Experience and/or Related Projects   Include all paid, volunteer, intern, or other experiences that are relevant to your objective   Start with most recent experience if using chronological format   Title held, organization name, city, state, or country location (if not U.S.A.)   Dates position held; if several positions for one employer, list employer once responsibilities listed in order of each  item\\'s relative value to the future employer; indicate transferable skills and adaptive abilities used on the job   Accomplishments on your job; what problems did you face?; what solutions did you find?   Contributions to the organization, i.e., ways your work helped increase profit, membership publicity, funding,  motivation, efficiency, productivity, quality; saved time or money; improved programs, management,  communication, information flow etc.   Quantitative or qualitative indicators that describe the results of your contributions or accomplishments, i.e.,  \"\"increased sales by $50,000\"\"; \"\"reduced staff turnover by 25%\"\"; \"\"significantly improved staffs ability to access  data\"\"   Learning/training that took place on the job that is relevant to your job objective (optional); describe  accomplishments in jargon of the field  Skills   Computer skills: software applications, languages, hardware, operating systems   Language skills: specific level of fluency and ability to read and write as \"\"basic,\"\" \"\"intermediate,\"\" or \"\"advanced\"\" or  \"\"fluent\"\"   Other   Students often share this section after Education or as the last section.  Extracurricular Activities, Community Service, Professional Associations   list of significant positions of responsibility; include title, name of organization or team, dates leadership roles,  achievements, and transferable skills that are relevant    Additional Resume Categories  To add relevant information to your resume that focuses on special knowledge or skills, consider the following resume headings:  EDUCATION  HONORS  PRESENTATIONS  RELATED PROJECTS  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE  PUBLICATIONS  RELATED EXPERIENCE  SCHOLARSHIPS  TRAINING  TECHNICAL SKILLS  LANGUAGES  PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS  LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE  INTERESTS  TRAVEL  VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE  SKILLS  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE  QUALIFICATIONS  ACCOMPLISHMENTS  SUMMARY    Proofread, Proofread, Proofread!

Does the idea of securing an entry-level job  with good long-term career growth appeal to you? If so, act now.  There is a lot that you can do to make such a position become a  reality.  Studies consistently show that the Number One factor in  helping college graduates transition to meaningful paid positions is  career related experience.  Career related experience can be gained in a variety of ways.  These include internships (paid or unpaid), cooperative education,  summer positions, voluntary experience, and part-time jobs. All  work experience is valuable, but experience directly related to  ones long-term career goals is the most meaningful.  This booklet is designed to help you write a resume that can  be used while you are still an undergraduate. Hopefully, a good  resume will help you obtain career-related experience before you  graduate.    2    INTERNSHIPS  At the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, the Office of  Career Services has been designated as the initial point of contact  for internships. Employers who are seeking interns from UPJ are  directed to this office. They work closely with academic  departments and faculty to refer students to employers. If you are  interested in an internship, talk to your faculty advisor or visit the  Career Services Office.    COOPERATIVE EDUCATION  Cooperative Education is a formalized program where  students alternate between semesters of full-time school and  semesters of full-time work. Co-op students normally have more  than one semester of co-op work experience prior to graduation.  The Universitys School of Engineering in Pittsburgh has a  Cooperative Education program through which UPJs Engineering  Technology students can be placed in co-op positions. ET students  who are interested in co-op should see their faculty advisor.  3    THE BIG \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d REFERRAL SYSTEM    The Big \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program is a computerized job referral system  developed by Career Services to notify UPJ students of part-time  and summer job opportunities. After job openings are received in  the Career Services Office, they are matched to the fields of  interest which are listed on the registration form. Once matches are  made, students are then sent a notice with a description of the job.  If the student is interested in the position, it is up to him/her to  contact the employer, usually by sending a resume and cover letter.  Register with the Big \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Career Services if you want to receive  notices about part-time and summer positions.    4    WHERE DO I LOOK FOR CAREER  RELATED POSITIONS?  By referring to the directories seniors use in their full-time  job hunt, you can start a list of all the companies for which you  would most like to work for. Most of the companies listed in  directories are very large and/or nationwide, but obviously, they  are also the companies that are able to conduct large summer  hiring programs.  Because smaller companies do not hire in great volume, it  can be more difficult to seek them out, but do not rule them out. A  good rule to follow is: dont leave any stone unturned. Joe  Schmos Fish Market may need summer help to balance the books.  A good place to look for summer positions is with the state or  the federal government. There are a vast number of opportunities  in the many agencies. A good way to find out about these  opportunities would be to check the websites;  www.usajobs.opm.gov and www.scsc.state.pa.us.  The best ways to find summer employment are to research,  write letters, talk to as many people as you can, and distribute your  resume as much as possible. Remember  Career Services can  provide you with a lot of good resources. Its to your advantage to  utilize this office.  And also, even if you dont get a position that provides  experience in your profession, you can gain valuable  communication and organizational skills simply by delivering  pizzas or waiting tables.    5    WHERE DO I LOOK FOR  A SUMMER JOB?  Many people dont realize that they have an effective job  referral system at their fingertips. This network uses no forms,  costs nothing, and has an amazing success rate  as high as 80  percent. All you need to do to take advantage of this job network is  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cget the word out\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to friends, relatives, professors, etc. Many jobs  are found just by asking people you know to keep an eye out for  job openings. Give your resume to these people. Ask them to  circulate it to those who might need a person with a background  like yours.  When picking up and dropping off an application, or a  resume (its always best to do these things in person), look sharp.  If a persons appearance is sloppy and unkempt, a potential  employer will take an application and file it away under \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNO  WAY!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If the position requires that you complete an application,  fill it out in blue or black ink, NEATLY. The appearance and  condition of your application could tell a great deal about you to an  employer. A great looking application may not get you a job, but a  sloppy application will most certainly stop you from being hired.  If you are asked to interview for a position, make sure you  are dressed properly. Neatness counts in any interview, so try to  look your best. Remove any facial piercing, cover tattoos, and  avoid extreme hairdos and clothing. Men should have facial hair  neatly groomed. Women should use make-up conservatively.  When interviewing for professional positions, professional  attire is expected.    6    HOW RESUMES FOR  UNDERGRADUATES DIFFER FROM  THOSE OF SENIORS AND ALUMNI  Whereas college graduates typically do not include information from  their high school years on their resumes, undergraduates may, and normally  do use such information. The younger you are, the more likely it is that you  will use information from your high school years.  Your objective (if you include one) should say that you are seeking a  summer position, a part-time job, an internship, or a co-op position. You  may choose to include your QPA if it is average or above.  It may help to list the courses that you have taken (in high school or  college) that relate to the position for which you are applying. It is generally  advisable to list your computer skills.  Even though career related experience is most significant, all work  experience is valuable. If you mowed lawns, worked in fast food, baby sat,  etcetera, dont shy away from putting it on your resume.  Your activities and interests can be a real asset. They can display a  great deal about you. They show how active you are, how willing you are to  serve others, and frequently indicate leadership traits and communication  and organizational skills.  You should have at least three references. Those that you list as  references should not be personal friends or family members. Teachers,  professors, and supervisors from places at which you worked make the best  references. List their name, title, place of employment, address, and  telephone number. References are normally typed on a separate sheet of  paper and given to the employer upon request.    7    RESUME WRITING TIPS  Writing a resume can be a daunting experience. The following is a  list of tips compiled from the advice of employers, career  counselors, and recent graduates whose resumes helped them land  meaningful employment.  \\xc2\\x99 Pay careful attention to spelling, punctuation, grammar, and  style.  \\xc2\\x99 Proofread your resume carefully, using a dictionary and  stylebook, and have several other people proofread it as well.  \\xc2\\x99 Organize information in a logical fashion.  \\xc2\\x99 Keep descriptions clear and to the point.  \\xc2\\x99 Confine your information to one page.  \\xc2\\x99 Use a simple, easy-to-read font.  \\xc2\\x99 Use good-quality white or off-white bond paper.  \\xc2\\x99 Include as much work experience as possible, even if it  doesnt obviously relate to the job youre seeking.  \\xc2\\x99 Tailor your information to the job youre seeking.  \\xc2\\x99 Seek help at your career services center.  For more information on preparing a resume and other jobsearch ideas, visit your career center.  National Association of Colleges and Employers    8    INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON  MOST RESUMES  1.) Personal Information: Name, Campus/Permanent Addresses, Telephone Numbers,  and an E-mail Address.  2.) *Employment Goals: (This is normally called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCareer Objective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or simply  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cObjective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Describe the type of work you desire. The objective should reflect your  short-range plans. For those with little or no full-time work experience, the development  of a concisely described job objective may be the most difficult task in compiling a  resume.  If you find that a specific career objective is too confining, or doesnt meet your needs,  there are options available:  a.) You may decide to write your objectives in functional terms that describe the type of  work activities you prefer instead of a description or title.  b.) Eliminate the employment goal section on your resume and incorporate your objective  in your cover letter.  c.) Have several resumes with different objectives that you would send to the appropriate  employers.  3.) Education: Name of College(s), Location, Dates, Degree(s), Major(s), Quality Point  Average*, Honors, and perhaps courses of particular value if they are related to  employment for which you are applying. Whereas college graduates typically do not  include high school background, undergraduates frequently find it advantageous to do so.  4.) Skills: You may decide to include a section that lists your computer skills, foreign  languages, licenses (CPR, commercial driving, etc.) and other skills.  5.) Experience: Part-time employment, summer employment, applicable college  projects, internships, volunteer work. (This section may be divided into three areas:  career-related experience, part-time employment, and summer experience). For  undergraduates with little or no full-time professional level work experience, it is very  important to include part-time and summer jobs\\xe2\\x80\\x94even if the type of work has no bearing  on academic or career plans. Remember that career related experience is most valuable,  but a proven track record of other successful experience also makes you a more attractive  candidate.  NOTE: It is much more important to emphasize what your experiences were  (description, explanation) rather than when and where (dates, places).  6.) Military Service: For those who have completed military obligations, the dates of  active duty and rank upon discharge should be included. When appropriate, include a  brief description of duties and responsibilities, particularly if the experience relates to  future employment. If you do not have any military experience, omit this section.    9    7.) Activities and Interests: These include extra-curricular college and/or community  experiences, and any leadership positions. A brief listing of hobbies or avocations is  acceptable. Teacher-education candidates should include all experiences working with  children and adolescents. Candidates for teaching positions might choose to include their  own high school activities.  8.) *References: List 3 or 4 persons. Give name, professional title, business address,  and business phone. These are normally listed on a separate sheet of paper. If you  decide not to list your references on your resume, you could indicate that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences are  available upon request.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Do not use personal friends and relatives as references.  Teachers, faculty, and former supervisors make the best references.  * indicates optional    Please Note:  Traditional advice has been to use \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when writing resumes and  cover letters. A list of \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you might consider using in your resume is  provided in the back of this booklet.  Although the use of \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is still considered important, you also  should be aware of a recent trend. Many large organizations are using computers  to do the first scanning of resumes. When scanned, these computers can quickly  review thousands of resumes. However, be aware that they normally scan for nouns  not verbs. Action verbs may have a greater effect when a human being does the first  scanning of your resume, but verbs may not impress a computer.  In essence, both action verbs and important descriptive nouns that describe  your qualifications (such as titles or positions) are important.    10    SAMPLE RESUMES    Please use the following resumes as examples only.  Look at all the resumes before you begin to  construct your own. Your resume will serve you best  if it is unique and highlights your own personal  qualifications. Choosing a format that you like and  then blending bits and pieces of a variety of  examples will make your resume appear as if it is  original. Resumes copied from somebody else or  produced from a template are normally not as  effective as original resumes.    11    Duncan Donaldson  Duncan444@upj.com  Home Address  84 Trueman Avenue  Altoona, PA 15947  (814) 555-8444    Campus Address  P.O.

Through this letter, you must make  the employer want to give you an interview. The cover letter  corresponds to the first five minutes of an interview, and your  manner and attitudes are conveyed as readily on paper as in person.  Therefore, you must follow certain standards to carefully write  effective cover letters. Some guidelines are the following:  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Every cover letter should be individually typed.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Quality paper should be used. (If your resume is on colored  paper, your cover letter should be on matching paper.)  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The letter must conform to good business style and be free of  errors.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The letter should be no more than one page in length  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The cover letter should indicate a special interest in the  organization. Receiving a generic resume and letter gives the  impression that you distributed them indiscriminately to any  organization that you pulled out of a hat.  These are some basic guidelines to preparing a cover letter.

Your company has an impressive track record for mentoring entry-level  accountants plus offering valuable experience in auditing, tax compliance and cost accounting. As  a Rowan University senior, anticipating graduation in May, I am anxious to interview with you  during your upcoming recruitment trip to our campus.  My strong academic performance and outstanding internship experience make me a strong  candidate for a junior accountant position with Coopers and Lybrand. As an honor student and  recipient of the Medallion Scholar Award for the internationally accredited College of Business, I  was chosen to intern for the local public accounting firm of Money and Associates CPA. At Money  and Associates, I assisted with the preparation of clients for corporate tax audits and performed  intake consultations for tax preparation purposes. My supervising accountant, Mr. Charles Money  invited me to continue my internship for a second semester. On my internship evaluation form he  wrote, \"\"John\\'s knowledge and ability to grasp accounting procedures and principles is quite  impressive. His computer skills and team-working abilities make him a valuable resource. I believe  John will develop into a top-notch accountant.\"\"  Enclosed is a copy of my resume, which outlines my qualifications in further detail. I look forward  to an opportunity to meet with you during the upcoming recruitment week at Rowan University. I  can be reached at 856-863-9547. Thank you for your time and consideration.    Respectfully,    Mr. Dwight Thompson  Human Resources Manager  Savitz Pharmaceuticals  856 Bozorth Parkway  Esby, NJ 08028  Dear Mr. Thompson:  In response to your advertisement in the Glassboro Examiner for a sales representative for Savitz  Pharmaceuticals, I hereby submit my letter of application. I was excited to read your ad since I  have had a long-time interest in pharmaceutical sales and your products sound particularly  appealing to me.  As a college student, I had the opportunity to experience in sales and customer service. Of  particular interest to you, I worked at Glassboro Medical Supply serving customers who enter our  store. Through reading professional periodicals and magazines that are sent to me as an  employee of Glassboro Medical Supply, I have become knowledgeable of the different types of  medical supplies. This knowledge enables me to fully address our customers medical supply  needs and answer their questions. Utilizing my proactive approach to sales and customer service,  I increased sales this year by 20% over last years figures. In light of my accomplishment, my  supervisor has given me the responsibility of developing a plan to market medical supplies to local  drug stores. In addition to my work experience, I recently completed a course in  drug/pharmacology terminology at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. Completion of  this course increased my knowledge of medicines and their effects.  I have always had a strong interest in the medical/pharmaceutical sales field and have attempted  to gain the knowledge and experience needed to work effectively in that capacity. With that in  mind, I feel I am highly qualified for the position of sales representative for Savitz Pharmaceuticals.  My enclosed resume outlines my qualifications in further detail. I welcome an opportunity to meet  with you at your convenience. I can be reached at 856-256-4322 or on my cell phone at 856- 2222348.  Thank you for your time and consideration.    John Q.

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a  great place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of  skills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more  specific to your major, intended industry, or job function.  A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action  verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified  through the accomplishment statement.    IV.

Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements  under each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently  graduated with a bachelors degree, those who are staying within the same career field,  and candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred  by employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and  clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories.

Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight  transferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and  employers.    VI.

Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics  The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,  and skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,  think of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect  candidate for the opportunity at hand.  Resume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best  practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content  and a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with  regard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify  the skills you possess and employers are seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should  keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing  elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the readers eye to rest.  Using .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A  10-12 point font size is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold  a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,  dates, etc. line up neatly on the page.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully  read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least  2-3 people proofread it as well.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when  you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,  quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry  or job function-specific) and transferable skills.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the  skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily  scan your resume for what he or she is seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is  assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy duties included...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy responsibilities  were\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.  Also, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your  most important information stands out.    3    II. Key Elements of a Successful Resume  Your First and Last Name  \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Phone number \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Email address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Street address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 City, state & zip code \\xe2\\x99\\xa6  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  OBJECTIVE  Create a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area  you are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be  omitted or substituted with a \\xe2\\x80\\x95Career Highlights\\xe2\\x80\\x96 or \\xe2\\x80\\x95Summary of Qualifications\\xe2\\x80\\x96 section.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  EDUCATION  Institution City, State  (Expected) Graduation Month Year  Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations  GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)  Other possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  EXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year  The position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of  the Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.  You can bold or italicize your title or your organization\\xe2\\x80\\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.  In this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the  skills employers are seeking.  Start with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when  possible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or  more skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.  Consider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?  What were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does  this experience relate to your internship/employment goal?  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year  Bulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.  Be specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.  Make sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or  making it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year  Using multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant  experience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.  Positions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.  In an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are  applying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.  Emphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.  Organization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter)  City, State Month Year - Month Year  This section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,  professional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \\xe2\\x80\\x95job title\\xe2\\x80\\x96 with the role you played.  Including bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  ADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and  interpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.]  Technology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For  example: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop.  Languages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish.    4    III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs  TRANSFERABLE SKILLS  Transferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those  that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your  bulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following:  CLERICAL  Bookkeeping  Classifying  Collecting  Compiling  Computing  Examining  Filing  Organizing  Recording  Word processing    CREATIVE  Designing  Developing  Establishing  Illustrating  Imagining  Improvising  Inventing  performing  Revitalizing  Visualizing    HUMAN RELATIONS  Advising  Assisting  Counseling  Empathizing  Facilitating  Guiding  Listening  Motivating  Representing  Serving    PUBLIC RELATIONS  Conducting  Consulting  Informing  Planning  Presenting  Promoting  Representing  Responding  Researching  Writing    RESEARCH  Assessing  Calculating  Collecting  Diagnosing  Evaluating  Examining  Extrapolating  Interviewing  Investigating  Synthesizing    COMMUNICATION  Editing  Explaining  Influencing  Interpreting  listening  Mediating  Promoting  Speaking  Translating  Writing    FINANCIAL  Accounting  Administering  Allocating  Auditing  Balancing  Calculating  Forecasting  Investing  Projecting    MANAGEMENT  Communicating  Consulting  Coordinating  Delegating  Directing  Evaluating  Leading  Negotiating  Persuading  Planning    PROBLEM SOLVING  Analyzing  Appraising  Diagnosing  Examining  Executing  Planning  Proving  Reasoning  Recognizing  Validating    TECHNICAL  Adjusting  Aligning  Assembling  Drafting  Engineering  Installing  Observing  Operating  Programming  Repairing    TRAINING  Adapting  Communicating  Demonstrating  Enabling  Encouraging  Evaluating  Explaining  Instructing  Planning  Stimulating    ACTION VERBS  Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a  reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary  the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences. Below is a list of verbs to help get you started.

An academic version of a resume that provides a professional archive of all your experiences related to your academic career  For graduate students, a CV is typically a few pages.

A CV should then be tailored to the position you are applying for by ordering your sections from most to least relevant   Use your CV as a professional archive and keep it updated with all your accomplishments  Tip: Consider consulting with a faculty member or advisor for advice and feedback on your CV because they often serve on hiring  committees and have experienced an academic job search.

It is important to keep in mind that your document should be  specific to your experience and the position for which you are applying. You have flexibility in the choice, naming, and placement of  sections. While your contact information and education are usually listed first, other sections can be in any order, based on your  strengths and the requirements of the position or opportunity. If you are unsure if you should provide a resume or a CV, you may  want to contact the organization directly to see which they prefer.    RESUME AND CV SECTIONS  Below is a list of common sections you may use when creating your document.

If  included along with a resume, references are on a separate page that is formatted to match your resume. If included as part of  your CV, references may be placed at the end of the document.    Page 2    TRANSFERABLE SKILLS:  As you begin your search for a career and/or job, it is important to know your qualifications and communicate these skills to an  employer through your resume, cover letter, and interview. Over the years you have developed many skills through your  coursework, extracurricular activities, and life experiences. Review the list below and identify which transferrable skills you have  and reflect on how you acquired these skills. Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the  skills gained from these experiences. For example, if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote, edited, and presented a  final research paper in front of your peers, you have used skills (gathering information, writing, problem-solving, presenting) which  are not limited to that specific academic discipline, but are transferable to many occupations.    Research and  planning    Human relations    Organizing,  management and  leadership    Work survival    The skillful expression  and interpretation of  knowledge and ideas.    The search for specific  knowledge and the ability  to conceptualize future  needs and solutions.    The use of interpersonal  skills for resolving  conflict, relating to and  helping people.    Ability to supervise and  guide individuals and  groups in the  completion of goals.    The daily skills that  assist in promoting  effective production and  work satisfaction.

Generally a graduate resume  should be 2-3 full pages and a CV should be 3-5 pages long. However, based on your experiences, career field, and the position  description, it could be longer or shorter. Whatever the case, only print your document on one side of the paper and include  your name and the page number at the top of each page.  Avoid using a resume or CV template. This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves.  Your resume or CV should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends a short amount of  time reading your document\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications.  To organize your document, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these  sparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead  of traditional, round, solid bullet points.  It is a good idea to start with a 1-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Font size should be  between 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy to read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond.  Keep font size and style consistent throughout your CV (except for your name, which should be a larger size).  Present your resume or CV on quality bond paper (20 pound)\\xe2\\x80\\x94choose white or off-white to ensure your document is easy to  read.  If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly, keep the format simple when  filling in required information.  If you are requested to submit your documents via email, save your resume or CV and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose.    TIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING:                          Make sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document. It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs  but also important to make it your own.  There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV, but there are also options and room for choice. If  you give your document to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested  guidelines, resumes and CVs are subjective.  Be 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations.  Organize your document so the most important information is at the top.  Do not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of  skill.  Personal information, such as marital status, age, ethnicity, height, and weight should not be included.  Avoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action  verbs.  Always proofread your resume or CV. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on  errors.  It is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description. You may have more than one version of your  document depending on the positions to which you are applying . You may change the order of sections to list more relevant  areas of your experience closer to the top.  Remember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employers first impression of you. It is also a  work in progress that you will continually revise.    ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:          Visit www.ccse.umn.edu to view our Resume Writing or Curriculum Vitae Workshops.

Also much time was required to port ABB  applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on  single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux  while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch.

{"id": 334, "text": "\"RESUME WRITING  Tips for resume formatting and content, with samples from alumni  A resume is a brief, concise document that presents, and effectively sells, your most relevant and positive credentials for  employment, admission to graduate school, consideration for a scholarship or fellowship, or other professional purpose.  An employer will usually spend 15 to 30 seconds reviewing your resume, so the content of your resume must be clear,  concise, and targeted to the type of job for which you are applying.    Preparation  Resumes should highlight skills and accomplishments that meet employer qualifications, excluding irrelevant  information and experiences. Well-designed resumes will be visually appealing and free from any spelling, typographical,  punctuation, or grammatical errors. All resumes should be written concisely in an organized format that presents the  most important information first.  Employers who read individual resumes spend very little time on each resume. Many large employers now use software  programs (Applicant Tracking Systems) to assist them with this initial review.  If your resume has a typo or grammatical error, it will probably jump off the page to an employer, and this is a way to  weed you out of a candidate pool. Your resume may be the only chance you get to make an impression, so make it a  good one.    Constructing Your Resume  Contact information  Begin your resume with your name by capitalizing and using bold type.   Include street address, city, state, and zip code.   Include a phone number(s) where you can be reached.   Include your e-mail address.  Objective (Optional)  The purpose of the objective statement is to inform the employer of your career goals and targeted interests. Objectives  are no longer as widely used as they once were, as employers expect you to cover the same information in more detail  in the cover letter. If you would like to include an objective, review the samples on the last page of this handout.  A career/job objective may be advantageous when:   You want to specify your interests and where you would fit in the organization.   You want to present the impression of a focused, self-confident person.  A career/job objective is not advantageous when it is:   Too broad and meaningless, reflecting indecision.   Too exclusive, eliminating you from jobs for which you might be considered.  Qualifications or Experience Summary (Optional)  A summary of qualifications can condense an extensive background by emphasizing experiences and accomplishments  in brief keyword phrases. The qualifications summary is accomplishment-oriented and provides an overview of your  work experience. It can also serve to summarize relevant academic, volunteer and leadership experience for those who  have limited work experience. A summary is most appropriate for someone with substantial experience, someone who  is changing careers and wants to demonstrate transferable skills, or someone with a varied background. Theyre most  often used by graduate students and working professionals.    Education  If your education relates to your objective and is within the past three years, it should be the first section. If not,  education should follow the work experience section of your resume.  In reverse-chronological order, this section includes the schools you have attended, dates of graduation or dates of  attendance, as well as degrees sought or completed. Other information that might be included: related coursework,  scholarships and honors, and special projects (e.g. research projects, teaching).   Start with your most recent degree or the program in which you are currently enrolled. List other degrees or  relevant education in reverse chronological order.   Highlight key info by using bold type or capital letters.   Most students begin with the university, followed by the location, degree, and graduation date. You can consider  listing your degree before the name of the university as well.   Should I include my GPA? If you are uncertain about including your GPA, ask a Career Services advisor for  recommendations based on your individual circumstances.  Within this section, you may also want to highlight coursework, research, or a study abroad experience.   Consider listing relevant coursework under the appropriate degree.   You may want to describe thesis, research or design projects (Note: You may want to have a separate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRelated  Course Projects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section  see examples in this handout).  Chronological Format  In the chronological resume, job history is organized chronologically with the most recent job listed first. Job titles and  employers are emphasized and duties and accomplishments are described in detail.   Begin with your current/most recent position and work backward, chronologically.   Devote more space to relevant employment/experiences.   If your job titles relate to your current job objective, start each position description with job titles. If not, begin  with the organization.   Follow job title and organizational information with the organization\\'s city and state.   Use the first and last month (or semester terms, such as Fall, Spring, and Summer) and year to describe dates of  employment.   Describe experiences related to the position youre applying for in detail. Summarize earlier positions unless  relevant to your objective. Within each listed position, stress the major accomplishments and responsibilities that  demonstrate your competency    Resume Checklist  The following checklist has been designed to assist you in writing your resume. This checklist reflects the expertise of the  Career Center staff developed through critiquing thousands of resumes, discussing selection criteria with numerous  employers, and gathering input from a wide range of career professionals.  Appearance   Is it inviting and easy to read; not too much information uses appropriate font styles (sans serif fonts are often  recommended but the serif font Times New Roman is accepted) and font sizes (10-12 pts.)   Incorporates enough white space between sections to facilitate skimming; adequate margins creates visual impact  (minimum is .5in on all four sides); using bullets; boldface, italics, and font sizes to emphasize key words (for  scannable resumes, use boldface only)  Organization and Format   Presents strongest qualifications first   Appropriate length: For most cases, one page for undergraduates, more for those with advanced degrees for  several years of post-grad work experience (2-3 pages)  Writing Style   Begins phrases with powerful action verbs              Short bullets (1-2 lines) with 2-6 bullets per experience (depending on how related it is to the opportunity you  seek); you can list an experience without listing bullets if you want the employer to know about your involvement  but its not directly related to the position  Brief, succinct language; no unnecessary words  Absolutely free from grammatical, spelling, punctuation, usage, and typographical errors    CONTENT:  Contact Information   Address, current and permanent (if necessary  otherwise just choose one)   Telephone number  Objective (Optional)   Briefly indicates the sort of position, title, and possible area of specialization sought   For management or supervisory positions, indicates level of responsibility sought   Language is specific, employer centered not self-centered; avoids broad or vague statements  Summary of Skills, Accomplishments, or Expertise (Optional)   Identifies 3-6 key achievements that support the objective   Summarizes relevant work experience and accomplishments that support the objective  Education   Highest level of attainment is listed first; work from most current degree backward degree in progress or most  recently completed degree; include name of university, location of university, type of degree and major, date of  graduation, list of other degrees, relevant higher education coursework, continuing professional education or  training   Courses, and study abroad   Second major, minor, or areas of concentration   Omit high school if you have completed more than two years of college unless referencing impressive honors or  relevant extracurricular activities   Relevant courses, papers, projects; include paper or project titles   GPA, honors, awards, scholarships  Employment Experience and/or Related Projects   Include all paid, volunteer, intern, or other experiences that are relevant to your objective   Start with most recent experience if using chronological format   Title held, organization name, city, state, or country location (if not U.S.A.)   Dates position held; if several positions for one employer, list employer once responsibilities listed in order of each  item\\'s relative value to the future employer; indicate transferable skills and adaptive abilities used on the job   Accomplishments on your job; what problems did you face?; what solutions did you find?   Contributions to the organization, i.e., ways your work helped increase profit, membership publicity, funding,  motivation, efficiency, productivity, quality; saved time or money; improved programs, management,  communication, information flow etc.   Quantitative or qualitative indicators that describe the results of your contributions or accomplishments, i.e.,  \"\"increased sales by $50,000\"\"; \"\"reduced staff turnover by 25%\"\"; \"\"significantly improved staffs ability to access  data\"\"   Learning/training that took place on the job that is relevant to your job objective (optional); describe  accomplishments in jargon of the field  Skills   Computer skills: software applications, languages, hardware, operating systems   Language skills: specific level of fluency and ability to read and write as \"\"basic,\"\" \"\"intermediate,\"\" or \"\"advanced\"\" or  \"\"fluent\"\"   Other   Students often share this section after Education or as the last section.  Extracurricular Activities, Community Service, Professional Associations   list of significant positions of responsibility; include title, name of organization or team, dates leadership roles,  achievements, and transferable skills that are relevant    Additional Resume Categories  To add relevant information to your resume that focuses on special knowledge or skills, consider the following resume headings:  EDUCATION  HONORS  PRESENTATIONS  RELATED PROJECTS  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE  PUBLICATIONS  RELATED EXPERIENCE  SCHOLARSHIPS  TRAINING  TECHNICAL SKILLS  LANGUAGES  PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS  LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE  INTERESTS  TRAVEL  VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE  SKILLS  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE  QUALIFICATIONS  ACCOMPLISHMENTS  SUMMARY    Proofread, Proofread, Proofread!

Does the idea of securing an entry-level job  with good long-term career growth appeal to you? If so, act now.  There is a lot that you can do to make such a position become a  reality.  Studies consistently show that the Number One factor in  helping college graduates transition to meaningful paid positions is  career related experience.  Career related experience can be gained in a variety of ways.  These include internships (paid or unpaid), cooperative education,  summer positions, voluntary experience, and part-time jobs. All  work experience is valuable, but experience directly related to  ones long-term career goals is the most meaningful.  This booklet is designed to help you write a resume that can  be used while you are still an undergraduate. Hopefully, a good  resume will help you obtain career-related experience before you  graduate.    2    INTERNSHIPS  At the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, the Office of  Career Services has been designated as the initial point of contact  for internships. Employers who are seeking interns from UPJ are  directed to this office. They work closely with academic  departments and faculty to refer students to employers. If you are  interested in an internship, talk to your faculty advisor or visit the  Career Services Office.    COOPERATIVE EDUCATION  Cooperative Education is a formalized program where  students alternate between semesters of full-time school and  semesters of full-time work. Co-op students normally have more  than one semester of co-op work experience prior to graduation.  The Universitys School of Engineering in Pittsburgh has a  Cooperative Education program through which UPJs Engineering  Technology students can be placed in co-op positions. ET students  who are interested in co-op should see their faculty advisor.  3    THE BIG \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d REFERRAL SYSTEM    The Big \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program is a computerized job referral system  developed by Career Services to notify UPJ students of part-time  and summer job opportunities. After job openings are received in  the Career Services Office, they are matched to the fields of  interest which are listed on the registration form. Once matches are  made, students are then sent a notice with a description of the job.  If the student is interested in the position, it is up to him/her to  contact the employer, usually by sending a resume and cover letter.  Register with the Big \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Career Services if you want to receive  notices about part-time and summer positions.    4    WHERE DO I LOOK FOR CAREER  RELATED POSITIONS?  By referring to the directories seniors use in their full-time  job hunt, you can start a list of all the companies for which you  would most like to work for. Most of the companies listed in  directories are very large and/or nationwide, but obviously, they  are also the companies that are able to conduct large summer  hiring programs.  Because smaller companies do not hire in great volume, it  can be more difficult to seek them out, but do not rule them out. A  good rule to follow is: dont leave any stone unturned. Joe  Schmos Fish Market may need summer help to balance the books.  A good place to look for summer positions is with the state or  the federal government. There are a vast number of opportunities  in the many agencies. A good way to find out about these  opportunities would be to check the websites;  www.usajobs.opm.gov and www.scsc.state.pa.us.  The best ways to find summer employment are to research,  write letters, talk to as many people as you can, and distribute your  resume as much as possible. Remember  Career Services can  provide you with a lot of good resources. Its to your advantage to  utilize this office.  And also, even if you dont get a position that provides  experience in your profession, you can gain valuable  communication and organizational skills simply by delivering  pizzas or waiting tables.    5    WHERE DO I LOOK FOR  A SUMMER JOB?  Many people dont realize that they have an effective job  referral system at their fingertips. This network uses no forms,  costs nothing, and has an amazing success rate  as high as 80  percent. All you need to do to take advantage of this job network is  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cget the word out\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to friends, relatives, professors, etc. Many jobs  are found just by asking people you know to keep an eye out for  job openings. Give your resume to these people. Ask them to  circulate it to those who might need a person with a background  like yours.  When picking up and dropping off an application, or a  resume (its always best to do these things in person), look sharp.  If a persons appearance is sloppy and unkempt, a potential  employer will take an application and file it away under \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNO  WAY!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If the position requires that you complete an application,  fill it out in blue or black ink, NEATLY. The appearance and  condition of your application could tell a great deal about you to an  employer. A great looking application may not get you a job, but a  sloppy application will most certainly stop you from being hired.  If you are asked to interview for a position, make sure you  are dressed properly. Neatness counts in any interview, so try to  look your best. Remove any facial piercing, cover tattoos, and  avoid extreme hairdos and clothing. Men should have facial hair  neatly groomed. Women should use make-up conservatively.  When interviewing for professional positions, professional  attire is expected.    6    HOW RESUMES FOR  UNDERGRADUATES DIFFER FROM  THOSE OF SENIORS AND ALUMNI  Whereas college graduates typically do not include information from  their high school years on their resumes, undergraduates may, and normally  do use such information. The younger you are, the more likely it is that you  will use information from your high school years.  Your objective (if you include one) should say that you are seeking a  summer position, a part-time job, an internship, or a co-op position. You  may choose to include your QPA if it is average or above.  It may help to list the courses that you have taken (in high school or  college) that relate to the position for which you are applying. It is generally  advisable to list your computer skills.  Even though career related experience is most significant, all work  experience is valuable. If you mowed lawns, worked in fast food, baby sat,  etcetera, dont shy away from putting it on your resume.  Your activities and interests can be a real asset. They can display a  great deal about you. They show how active you are, how willing you are to  serve others, and frequently indicate leadership traits and communication  and organizational skills.  You should have at least three references. Those that you list as  references should not be personal friends or family members. Teachers,  professors, and supervisors from places at which you worked make the best  references. List their name, title, place of employment, address, and  telephone number. References are normally typed on a separate sheet of  paper and given to the employer upon request.    7    RESUME WRITING TIPS  Writing a resume can be a daunting experience. The following is a  list of tips compiled from the advice of employers, career  counselors, and recent graduates whose resumes helped them land  meaningful employment.  \\xc2\\x99 Pay careful attention to spelling, punctuation, grammar, and  style.  \\xc2\\x99 Proofread your resume carefully, using a dictionary and  stylebook, and have several other people proofread it as well.  \\xc2\\x99 Organize information in a logical fashion.  \\xc2\\x99 Keep descriptions clear and to the point.  \\xc2\\x99 Confine your information to one page.  \\xc2\\x99 Use a simple, easy-to-read font.  \\xc2\\x99 Use good-quality white or off-white bond paper.  \\xc2\\x99 Include as much work experience as possible, even if it  doesnt obviously relate to the job youre seeking.  \\xc2\\x99 Tailor your information to the job youre seeking.  \\xc2\\x99 Seek help at your career services center.  For more information on preparing a resume and other jobsearch ideas, visit your career center.  National Association of Colleges and Employers    8    INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ON  MOST RESUMES  1.) Personal Information: Name, Campus/Permanent Addresses, Telephone Numbers,  and an E-mail Address.  2.) *Employment Goals: (This is normally called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCareer Objective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or simply  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cObjective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Describe the type of work you desire. The objective should reflect your  short-range plans. For those with little or no full-time work experience, the development  of a concisely described job objective may be the most difficult task in compiling a  resume.  If you find that a specific career objective is too confining, or doesnt meet your needs,  there are options available:  a.) You may decide to write your objectives in functional terms that describe the type of  work activities you prefer instead of a description or title.  b.) Eliminate the employment goal section on your resume and incorporate your objective  in your cover letter.  c.) Have several resumes with different objectives that you would send to the appropriate  employers.  3.) Education: Name of College(s), Location, Dates, Degree(s), Major(s), Quality Point  Average*, Honors, and perhaps courses of particular value if they are related to  employment for which you are applying. Whereas college graduates typically do not  include high school background, undergraduates frequently find it advantageous to do so.  4.) Skills: You may decide to include a section that lists your computer skills, foreign  languages, licenses (CPR, commercial driving, etc.) and other skills.  5.) Experience: Part-time employment, summer employment, applicable college  projects, internships, volunteer work. (This section may be divided into three areas:  career-related experience, part-time employment, and summer experience). For  undergraduates with little or no full-time professional level work experience, it is very  important to include part-time and summer jobs\\xe2\\x80\\x94even if the type of work has no bearing  on academic or career plans. Remember that career related experience is most valuable,  but a proven track record of other successful experience also makes you a more attractive  candidate.  NOTE: It is much more important to emphasize what your experiences were  (description, explanation) rather than when and where (dates, places).  6.) Military Service: For those who have completed military obligations, the dates of  active duty and rank upon discharge should be included. When appropriate, include a  brief description of duties and responsibilities, particularly if the experience relates to  future employment. If you do not have any military experience, omit this section.    9    7.) Activities and Interests: These include extra-curricular college and/or community  experiences, and any leadership positions. A brief listing of hobbies or avocations is  acceptable. Teacher-education candidates should include all experiences working with  children and adolescents. Candidates for teaching positions might choose to include their  own high school activities.  8.) *References: List 3 or 4 persons. Give name, professional title, business address,  and business phone. These are normally listed on a separate sheet of paper. If you  decide not to list your references on your resume, you could indicate that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences are  available upon request.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Do not use personal friends and relatives as references.  Teachers, faculty, and former supervisors make the best references.  * indicates optional    Please Note:  Traditional advice has been to use \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when writing resumes and  cover letters. A list of \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you might consider using in your resume is  provided in the back of this booklet.  Although the use of \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is still considered important, you also  should be aware of a recent trend. Many large organizations are using computers  to do the first scanning of resumes. When scanned, these computers can quickly  review thousands of resumes. However, be aware that they normally scan for nouns  not verbs. Action verbs may have a greater effect when a human being does the first  scanning of your resume, but verbs may not impress a computer.  In essence, both action verbs and important descriptive nouns that describe  your qualifications (such as titles or positions) are important.    10    SAMPLE RESUMES    Please use the following resumes as examples only.  Look at all the resumes before you begin to  construct your own. Your resume will serve you best  if it is unique and highlights your own personal  qualifications. Choosing a format that you like and  then blending bits and pieces of a variety of  examples will make your resume appear as if it is  original. Resumes copied from somebody else or  produced from a template are normally not as  effective as original resumes.    11    Duncan Donaldson  Duncan444@upj.com  Home Address  84 Trueman Avenue  Altoona, PA 15947  (814) 555-8444    Campus Address  P.O.

Through this letter, you must make  the employer want to give you an interview. The cover letter  corresponds to the first five minutes of an interview, and your  manner and attitudes are conveyed as readily on paper as in person.  Therefore, you must follow certain standards to carefully write  effective cover letters. Some guidelines are the following:  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Every cover letter should be individually typed.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Quality paper should be used. (If your resume is on colored  paper, your cover letter should be on matching paper.)  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The letter must conform to good business style and be free of  errors.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The letter should be no more than one page in length  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The cover letter should indicate a special interest in the  organization. Receiving a generic resume and letter gives the  impression that you distributed them indiscriminately to any  organization that you pulled out of a hat.  These are some basic guidelines to preparing a cover letter.  What follows are some examples of cover letters dealing with  direct solicitation to employers, response to newspaper ads, and  referral from the placement office. These are provided to give  you an idea of how cover letters are written; remember that the  ones you write should reflect your qualities to the potential  employer.

{"id": 341, "text": "\"CHEMISTRY R\\xc3\\x89SUM\\xc3\\x89S  1. There is no absolute right format. This is your personal work, so create a resume that represents you well and that  you like. However, be sure that you follow basic guidelines:  A. Make sure your resume says the most about you in the fewest number of words (one page is recommended for  Bachelors level students, 2 pages for graduate students\\xe2\\x80\\xa6but there are some exceptions, e.g. more than ten  years of employment experience).  B. Be consistent with your format! Margins, bolding, capitalization, and style must be consistent as well as order  and style of information.  C. Proofread for typing and spelling accuracy.  2. Only items leading directly to setting up an interview should be included. Keep your resume specific to the job  you are applying for, even if that means having different resumes for different jobs. (E.g. one resume for researchrelated positions and another for sales positions.) Salary requirements, supervisors names, abbreviations, clich\\xc3\\xa9s,  reasons for leaving jobs, personal opinions and personal information such as height, weight, age, marital status,  etc. should be excluded.  A. Required Categories: (Heading) Name, Address, Phone Number (Note: Be sure your phone number is  prominent. Employers who cannot find--or read--your telephone number will not call!),  Email Address; (Body) Education, Experience (Work and/or Activities).  B. Optional Categories: (Body) Objective, Relevant Coursework, Honors & Awards, Activities, Credentials,  Skills, Computer Skills, Publications or Presentations, Professional Affiliations, and  Other.  3. If you do include an objective, be sure that it shows your career goals. It must be narrow and specific and include  your strengths as they apply to the position. (E.g. To obtain a position as a Chemical Engineer at a growing  company where I can use my research abilities and excellent communication skills to create advanced products in  a team setting.)  4. Both the resume and cover letter should be examples of your best work! Maintain a positive tone by excluding  negative aspects of your experience.  5. Choose a conservative font such as Helvetica, Times, Courier, Geneva, New York, Palatino, or a sans serif font no  smaller than 10 and no larger than 14. Include as much \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite space\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as possible for easier scanning by the  employer.  6. Make your resume look professional. If you make a hard copy, use only a laser printer on good quality bond  paper. Use white, off white, or a light blue or gray, 8-1/2\"\" X 11\"\" bond paper. (Remember that your potential  employer may photocopy your resume, so be sure that the paper is not too dark or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblotchy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to photocopy well!).  7. Be specific with dates, job titles, employers, interests, and accomplishments. Be complete and descriptive without  being too long. Always be completely accurate and truthful!  8. Use what is called telegraphic style. Omit all personal pronouns (I, we, they, you, etc.) Use incomplete sentences  in list form (no paragraphs!) without punctuation.  9. Use results oriented, \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in describing your experience. Words such as administered, coordinated,  developed, created, implemented, managed, and prepared are keys in telling employers what you have  accomplished. Use past tense unless you are describing a job you are currently doing (in which case present tense  or past tense is acceptable). Career Services has additional recommendations for action verbs.  10. Do not staple, paper clip, fold, or put your resume in a folder. Use the larger 9\"\" X 12\"\" envelopes to mail and be  sure watermarks, if your paper has them, are right-side up.

Closing: Sincerely, Kind Regards, Best, Respectfully followed by exact name on your resume    and time(s) and method to best reach you.    Resume and Cover Letter Tips @ MS of Electrical Engineering    2013-2014 Academic Year    Always avoid clich\\xc3\\xa9s ( \\xe2\\x80\\x98 I am a hard worker ) . Highlight your strengths, but always follow up statements ab  out your competencies ( \\xe2\\x80\\x98 I have advanced technical skills) with a specific example.    Questions to ask yourself  1. Does this resume stand up to the brand I wish to convey to employers?  Your resume is a marketing presentation of you. It is a document with a purpose and summarizes  your education, experience, and skills in short, concrete, result-oriented phrases that puts together  the right picture of you.  2. Which three people can I show this to for a variety of responses and constructive criticism?  You need a resume that can appeal to different pairs of eyes and people are subjective so be sure  to gather various opinions during your editing process.  3. What should I put in the cover letter rather than in the resume?  The cover letter is an opportunity to introduce yourself in full sentences and should explain how  you learned about the position and why you are interested and qualified for the role in comparison  to a resume which highlights the tasks and responsibilities of your work and educational experience  in bullet points. Also note, there is a difference between a formal 3-4 paragraph cover letter and an  email introduction to the prospective employer. The email form should be a brief 1 paragraph note  that pulls from the first and last paragraph of your formal cover letter and should be edited and  reviewed thoroughly for errors before hitting send!    Ingredients for a Knock-out Resume  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Keep your resume to one page.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Use an attractive and professional layout.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Catch the readers attention in 15 seconds.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Start each bullet point with an active verb    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Make everything positive on your resume. Your resume should convey a sense of vitality and an  image of you progressing smoothly and confidently through your career rather than having bumps.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Tailor your resume to a job description whenever possible. Identify the five main qualities in the  description and make sure those five qualities or as many as you can describe that are clearly  demonstrated in your resume.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Highlight achievements, rather than listing everything you have done.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Avoid raising unanswered questions and dont leaving gaps in your resume. Whether you served in  the military or did some traveling while unemployed or took a sabbatical, include a brief description  to set the tone of a continued career progression    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Proofread  not just spell/grammar check! Check for tenses! Make sure to set your computer  language to U.S. English.    \\xe2\\x80\\xa2    DO NOT Include:  o Personal Information (too personal)  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Age, gender, marital status, number of children  o Repetitious use of words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResponsible for\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Duties include\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    Resume and Cover Letter Tips @ MS of Electrical Engineering  o  o  o  o    Your GPA, if less than 3.0  Long narrations  List of references or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReference Available Upon Request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  JPEGS, TIFFs, Animation    2013-2014 Academic Year    FIRST LAST  425 Riverside Ave # 9A Manhattan NY 10027    123-456-7139\\xc2\\xb7ab1234@columbia.edu    EDUCATION  Columbia University, School of Engineering and Applied Science    New York, NY    MS in Electrical Engineering, GPA 3.79/4  Expected Dec 2012  Courses: Digital VLSI Circuits, Analog Electronic Circuits, Communication Circuits, Analog System in VLSI, Millimeter Wave Circuits,  Advanced Analog Integrated Circuits, Advanced Digital Electronic Circuits.

This is your personal work, so create a resume that represents you well and that  you like. However, be sure that you follow basic guidelines:  A. Make sure your resume says the most about you in the fewest number of words (one page is recommended for  Bachelors level students, 2 pages for graduate students\\xe2\\x80\\xa6but there are some exceptions, e.g. more than ten  years of employment experience).  B. Be consistent with your format! Margins, bolding, capitalization, and style must be consistent as well as order  and style of information.  C. Proofread for typing and spelling accuracy.  2. Only items leading directly to setting up an interview should be included. Keep your resume specific to the job  you are applying for, even if that means having different resumes for different jobs. (E.g. one resume for researchrelated positions and another for sales positions.) Salary requirements, supervisors names, abbreviations, clich\\xc3\\xa9s,  reasons for leaving jobs, personal opinions and personal information such as height, weight, age, marital status,  etc. should be excluded.  A. Required Categories: (Heading) Name, Address, Phone Number (Note: Be sure your phone number is  prominent. Employers who cannot find--or read--your telephone number will not call!),  Email Address; (Body) Education, Experience (Work and/or Activities).  B. Optional Categories: (Body) Objective, Relevant Coursework, Honors & Awards, Activities, Credentials,  Skills, Computer Skills, Publications or Presentations, Professional Affiliations, and  Other.  3. If you do include an objective, be sure that it shows your career goals. It must be narrow and specific and include  your strengths as they apply to the position. (e.g. To obtain a position as a Chemical Engineer at a growing  company where I can use my research abilities and excellent communication skills to create advanced products in  a team setting.)  4. Both the resume and cover letter should be examples of your best work! Maintain a positive tone by excluding  negative aspects of your experience.  5.

Include as much \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite space\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as possible for easier scanning by the  employer.  6. Make your resume look professional. If you make a hard copy, use only a laser printer on good quality bond  paper. Use white, off white, or a light blue or gray, 8-1/2\"\" X 11\"\" bond paper. (Remember that your potential  employer may photocopy your resume, so be sure that the paper is not too dark or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblotchy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to photocopy well!).  7. Be specific with dates, job titles, employers, interests, and accomplishments. Be complete and descriptive without  being too long. Always be completely accurate and truthful!  8. Use what is called telegraphic style. Omit all personal pronouns (I, we, they, you, etc.) Use incomplete sentences  in list form (no paragraphs!) without punctuation.  9. Use results oriented, \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in describing your experience. Words such as administered, coordinated,  developed, created, implemented, managed, and prepared are keys in telling employers what you have  accomplished. Use past tense unless you are describing a job you are currently doing (in which case present tense  or past tense is acceptable). Career Services has additional recommendations for action verbs.  10. Do not staple, paper clip, fold, or put your resume in a folder. Use the larger 9\"\" X 12\"\" envelopes to mail and be  sure watermarks, if your paper has them, are right-side up.

With my  engineering coursework and project experience, my innovative mindset and affinity for problem  solving, and my history of successful team projects, I believe I am a strong candidate for this  role.  As an undergraduate, I have balanced a rigorous course load and a number of extracurricular  activities that have allowed me to enhance my skills relevant to this role. Specific to  engineering, through my academic project work I have developed abilities in 3-D design and  modeling, an understanding of materials, and have practiced different manufacturing  technologies. For example, in my Machine Design and Manufacturing course, I along with two  teammates created mechanical drawings and designs in SolidWorks. We then modeled,  machined and assembled the parts of a working Stirling engine, meeting or exceeding all  requirements and deadlines. I have also developed the strong interpersonal and  communication skills required to succeed as the R&D Product Development intern; in addition  to academic team projects that require collaboration and strong writing and presentation skills,  I have been selected by my peers for a leadership role within Penn\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x99s Formula SAE team this  year, and am an active member of our ASME chapter. Throughout all of my experiences, I have  used my dedication to efficient and creative problem solving and my ability to prioritize and  manage competing demands to positive ends. I am eager to apply my engineering knowledge  and skills at the Consumer Products Company.  I am very interested in interviewing for this opportunity and look forward to learning more  about your requirements. Attached, please find my resume for your consideration; it contains  not only a further description of my Stirling Engine project, but a more in-depth review of other  related projects and experiences that I would be glad to discuss with you.

Use what is called telegraphic style. Omit all personal pronouns (I, we, they, you, etc.) Use incomplete sentences  in list form (no paragraphs!) without punctuation.  9. Use results oriented, \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in describing your experience. Words such as administered, coordinated,  developed, created, implemented, managed, and prepared are keys in telling employers what you have  accomplished. Use past tense unless you are describing a job you are currently doing (in which case present tense  or past tense is acceptable). Career Services has additional recommendations for action verbs.  10. Do not staple, paper clip, fold, or put your resume in a folder. Use the larger 9\"\" X 12\"\" envelopes to mail and be  sure watermarks, if your paper has them, are right-side up.

{"id": 377, "text": "\"CHEMICAL ENGINEERING R\\xc3\\x89SUM\\xc3\\x89S  1. There is no absolute right format. This is your personal work, so create a resume that represents you well and that  you like. However, be sure that you follow basic guidelines:  A. Make sure your resume says the most about you in the fewest number of words (one page is recommended for  Bachelors level students, 2 pages for graduate students\\xe2\\x80\\xa6but there are some exceptions, e.g. more than ten  years of employment experience).  B. Be consistent with your format! Margins, bolding, capitalization, and style must be consistent as well as order  and style of information.  C. Proofread for typing and spelling accuracy.  2. Only items leading directly to setting up an interview should be included. Keep your resume specific to the job  you are applying for, even if that means having different resumes for different jobs. (E.g. one resume for researchrelated positions and another for sales positions.) Salary requirements, supervisors names, abbreviations, clich\\xc3\\xa9s,  reasons for leaving jobs, personal opinions and personal information such as height, weight, age, marital status,  etc. should be excluded.  A. Required Categories: (Heading) Name, Address, Phone Number (Note: Be sure your phone number is  prominent. Employers who cannot find--or read--your telephone number will not call!),  Email Address; (Body) Education, Experience (Work and/or Activities).  B. Optional Categories: (Body) Objective, Relevant Coursework, Honors & Awards, Activities, Credentials,  Skills, Computer Skills, Publications or Presentations, Professional Affiliations, and  Other.  3. If you do include an objective, be sure that it shows your career goals. It must be narrow and specific and include  your strengths as they apply to the position. (e.g. To obtain a position as a Chemical Engineer at a growing  company where I can use my research abilities and excellent communication skills to create advanced products in  a team setting.)  4. Both the resume and cover letter should be examples of your best work! Maintain a positive tone by excluding  negative aspects of your experience.  5. Choose a conservative font such as Helvetica, Times, Courier, Geneva, New York, Palatino, or a sans serif font no  smaller than 10 and no larger than 14. Include as much \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite space\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as possible for easier scanning by the  employer.  6. Make your resume look professional. If you make a hard copy, use only a laser printer on good quality bond  paper. Use white, off white, or a light blue or gray, 8-1/2\"\" X 11\"\" bond paper. (Remember that your potential  employer may photocopy your resume, so be sure that the paper is not too dark or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblotchy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to photocopy well!).  7. Be specific with dates, job titles, employers, interests, and accomplishments. Be complete and descriptive without  being too long. Always be completely accurate and truthful!  8. Use what is called telegraphic style. Omit all personal pronouns (I, we, they, you, etc.) Use incomplete sentences  in list form (no paragraphs!) without punctuation.  9. Use results oriented, \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction verbs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in describing your experience. Words such as administered, coordinated,  developed, created, implemented, managed, and prepared are keys in telling employers what you have  accomplished. Use past tense unless you are describing a job you are currently doing (in which case present tense  or past tense is acceptable). Career Services has additional recommendations for action verbs.  10. Do not staple, paper clip, fold, or put your resume in a folder. Use the larger 9\"\" X 12\"\" envelopes to mail and be  sure watermarks, if your paper has them, are right-side up.

{"id": 379, "text": "\"your resume and try to determine if they have a position that would work for you. An objective statement that  says you want a position that offers growth and advancement and the opportunity to expand on your education  and training tells an employer that you are looking for what they can do for you, not what you can do for them.    EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE...What to put first  If your education is more pertinent to the work you are seeking than your employment history, list your  education first. If your education is very pertinent to the job, you may wish to list specific course titles that you  have completed that are directly related to the work you would be doing. If your employment history is more  pertinent, it should be listed first on your resume.    ACADEMIC BACKGROUND  Your academic background should be included in the resume with your most recently obtained degree or most  advanced degree listed first. The usual method is to list the school name, city and state, degree earned and date  of graduation. If you are currently enrolled in school, you can list your projected date of graduation.  If you have received \\xe2\\x80\\x9chonors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at school, were elected class president, or supported yourself through college you  can add those achievements to your resume under a heading such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonors and Achievements.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  If you feel that some of your coursework will be valuable to you on the job, you may want a heading called  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMajor Coursework\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPertinent Coursework\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where you would list specific classes by name. If the name of  the course does not make it obvious what the content of the course was, you may want to add this information in  parentheses.    OTHER POSSIBLE TOPIC OR SKILL HEADINGS  Equipment  Computer Expertise  Qualifications Highlights/Summary    Language Competency  Licenses/Certificates  Additional Training  Professional Affiliations  Strengths/Accomplishments/Achievements    REFERENCES  There are mixed opinions as to whether or not to have a references notation on your resume. If you are  squeezed for space, it is probably in your best interest to use the space to sell yourself to the employer. On the  other hand, if you are just starting out in the job market, there is no harm in noting that you do have references  available on your resume. You should have references available to hand to the employer immediately, and may  want to include them with your resume as part of your application packet.  References are usually the last heading on your resume, and are usually listed as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvailable upon Request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences Attached, Additional References Available Upon Request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferences and Portfolio Available  Upon Request.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Be sure that you have them typed and ready to hand out. References should not be listed  individually on the resume itself, but rather on a separate sheet, with an indication as to your relationship to the  person you are listing as a reference. For work related references you might list company presidents, managers,  supervisors, co-workers, or clients. Personal references can include friends, faculty, landlords, etc. Providing a  list of references works as long as a reference is still available at your prior employer. A letter of  recommendation gives you a hedge against the day that your reference moves on and you can no longer refer  potential employers to them.  Be sure that you ask a person if they are willing to be a reference for you before you list them as a reference.  Check with your listed references regularly to be sure that they are still available.  4    LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION  If possible, get a written letter of recommendation from as many people as possible before you leave a job or  soon afterwards. A written recommendation is a known quantity. You can never be sure what someone says  about you in a verbal recommendation. Written letters of recommendation may be attached to a resume, or  given to a potential employer separately with your references. A letter of recommendation can speak about you  in more glowing terms than you would feel comfortable describing yourself. Many employers want to speak to  a reference rather than read a letter of recommendation. They distrust letters of recommendation, knowing that  you would be unlikely to provide a less than glowing one, and want to talk to your reference directly, or even  circumvent your listed references and speak to other people who may have worked with you at the company.  Always check with your references before listing them on an application to be sure that they are still available  and willing to act as a reference for you. If you are uneasy about what your references may be saying about  you, you can hire a reference checking service, or have a friend act as a potential employer and call the  reference you are concerned about. If you choose to go this route, give them a script to work from. Many  companies have a reference policy and will only verify that you were an employee and the dates that you  worked for that company.    WHAT NOT TO PUT IN YOUR RESUME  Do not put your age, sex, marital status, number of children, religious affiliation, ethnic origin, height, weight or  health status. This information may be used to discriminate against you, and is illegal for employers to ask  prior to hiring you. It is also advisable not to list political or professional affiliations unless they are directly job  related.  Do not include past salaries or anticipated starting salary. This information may be requested by an employer,  however the consensus with employment professionals is that it is not in your best interest to include the  information in writing. You have to choose whether or not you feel you background is strong enough that they  will want to speak to you without this information. If you include a section of hobbies or extracurricular  activities, it is recommended that you leave out any activities that could be considered physically hazardous.  Employers want you on the job, not recovering from your recreational activities.    REMEMBER  Your resume should be free of spelling, grammatical and typographical errors. Have it proof read. Never  assume that a computer spell check will find all errors. Keep it simple. Do not use brightly colored paper or a  variety of graphics or fonts or font sizes.  Have your resume printed on good quality, rag bond paper. Have you references list and letters of  recommendation and cover letter printed on the same paper as your resume. If possible, avoid plain white  paper.  If your resume will be scanned (not a usual occurrence in Santa Cruz, but common in Silicon Valley), be sure to  provide a scanner friendly version.  If you are doing a web based resume, be sure any links to or from that web link are professional. Do not post  your picture on-line as part of your on-line resume.  Do not send out a resume that has cross outs or things handwritten in. Take the time to do it right.  5    KEY WORDS FOR RESUME PREPARATION  Ability  Accelerated  Accomplished  Accurate  Achieved  Active  Adapted  Adjusted  Administer  Advertised  Advised  Aggressive

Check  out her or his name, title and honorarium (Dr., Mr., Ms., Miss., or Mrs.). You can usually get this information  from the business switchboard operator or receptionist. Be sure that you have the spelling right.

If you are applying to a large company,  offering similar career opportunities in more that one department, send a letter and resume to each department  head. In this instance you would want to keep your career objective statement flexible, but not so flexible that  they are not sure about the position you are seeking.

Sincerely,  Ellen James  1912 Cedar Street  Santa Cruz, CA 95060  831-XXX-XXXX    28    SCANNABLE RESUMES  The key points to remember in creating a resume that will translate well when processed through a scanner  for selection are SIMPLICITY & TERMINOLOGY.  Scanners look for key words when sorting resumes into employment categories and awarding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoints\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for  consideration. Many of the things that are important in a resume that is being reviewed by a person, will work  against you when a resume is being scanned by a machine. If you are sending resumes to companies that use  scanners, and companies that do not use scanners, you will need two styles of resume. You may also want to  send both styles of resume to the same company, with an indication that one is for scanning and the other for  the hiring manager to read.  SIMPLICITY : Use plain text only. Do not use italics , bold face, or underlines. (See resume on page 21)  Do not use shading, borders, graphics or bullets. Use a font that is 11-14 points and is simple and easy to read  such as CG Times, Palatino, Bookman, etc.  Be sure that your name is on the top line by itself. Print the resume on a laser printer if possible and send a  crisp, clean copy on white paper. Use white space. Scanners recognize that white spaces separate categories.  TERMINOLOGY - Scanners search for key words. Use nouns rather than verbs, Words like systems  engineering, accounting, public relations, IBM, manager, etc., The more you can use appropriate terminology,  the more points you accumulate. With the exception of common abbreviations such as IBM or B.A.,  (Bachelor of Arts), you will want to minimize the use of abbreviations, and be sure to use words that have a  common definition.  Scanners are designed to look for key words which describe job titles, functions, skills, academic degrees,  relevant training, equipment, computer hardware and software, technical and industry jargon, and relevant  personality traits.  A one page resume is no longer the rule for scannable resumes. You can many times re-work your existing  resume by eliminating the fancy graphics and adding a key word section at the end of the resume. Include  all of the job specific words that apply to either your education, experience or the job qualifications which you  meet.  One of the major distributors of resume scanning technology is a company called Resumix  (http://www.resumix.com/). They offer a site that allows you to create an on-line resume  (http://www.resumix.com/mwb/resume-form.html). There are many other resume creation sites also available on  the internet.  POSTING YOUR RESUME ON-LINE  Submitting your resume to an on-line job referral service can be as easy as sending an email. Some sites want  you to follow their format and fill in boxes on an e-form, some allow you to cut and paste from a word document.  Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, HotJobs.com, CALJobs.ca.gov and additional sites listed on Hot Jobs Links on  our Cabrillo College Student Employment web site are all potential sites for you to post your resume on-line.  Some sites offer \"\"push technology\"\" where you can post your e-mail address and have jobs that meet your stated  criteria sent to you as they are listed.  29    WEB RESUMES  Anyone can have a web resume if they have access to a web site, although they are more common for people  with technical expertise or artistic abilities. Posting your resume on-line gives you the ability to appear to be  technologically savvy, but also provides a window for anyone with a good search engine to get more  information about you than you might like to provide. You may not want to post your address or land line  phone on an web resume.  In a web resume, you can provide copies of letters of recommendation, links to projects that you have done on  the web, show off a portfolio of art work, and have your resume available to anyone at anytime. Web  Resumes allow you to expand on a simple paper resume and creative side. Be sure not to include a picture of  yourself as part of this resume.    E-MAILING YOUR RESUME  When e-mailing your resume to an employer it is a good idea to give them the option as to how they would  like to view your resume. You can send it as a word attachment, but it is also a good idea to include it as plain  text in the body of your e-mail to the employer. Not every one feels comfortable accepting attachments due to  the potential for virus contamination. When sending an ASCII resume, be sure to send it to a couple of  friends who use different browsers, as it may not look the same when received as it did when you sent it.  Have your friends print you a copy so that you can come up with a version to e-mail that will have a good  readable layout when received.  FINAL TIPS  Focus the resume on the job you are applying for. Think what you can do for the employer. Which  of your skills are the most applicable for the job you are applying for.  Start with what will sell you best to the employer. If your education is more relevant than your  work history, lead with your education. If your work history is more relevant, lead with that. If you  have acquired skills from other venues that are your greatest strengths, lead with a summary of those  skills.  Use strong terminology. Key words, action words and strong phrasing are very important.  Keep it honest. Do not embellish your background with degrees you have not earned or job titles that  you have not held.  Make it easy to read, with no errors. Use white space appropriately. Have it proof read by several  different people before printing your final draft. Listen to suggestions, but realize that there is no one  best way to do a resume, and that only you can make the final decision as to how to market yourself on  paper to a prospective employer.  30\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": []}

What follows are details about the assets I will bring to the students  participating in your organizations program.  As a senior majoring in Economics/Political Science, with extensive involvement in leadership  and student life, many of my relevant experiences have been acquired during my college career. I  have served as a president for Students in Free Enterprise chapter, and in this capacity, I learned  how to effectively organize fundraising events, develop educational activities for high school  students, and promote understanding of free market values in Twin Falls. As well, I regularly  approached local business people for investments in our educational program. Selecting and  scheduling engaging guest speakers for major campus events was also part of my role. Moreover,  I have developed a program budget, and handled a clubs financial responsibilities.  As a facilitator, I have led productive group processes, and even organized summits on both  diplomacy and leadership for high school students from all over the world. The role of educator  is one I genuinely enjoy, particularly when I can facilitate discussions and team-building  activities with student groups students. Further, my varied work experience has allowed me to  hone my computer abilities, such as database maintenance and record management for over 300  student organizations.  In short, my marketing, leadership, facilitation, and interpersonal communication skills would be  of great benefit to the students involved in Junior Achievement Idaho. Promoting global  awareness and a respect for diversity is a passion of mine that I enjoy sharing. Being a Junior  Achievement Intern would enable me to once again enhance the business and marketing related  educational experiences of high school age Idahoans. I would welcome the opportunity to assist  these youth, and learn more about working with a nonprofit organization. I look forward to  hearing from you soon.

Expanded participation in University Interscholastic League Literary Competition    PHILOSOPHY  I believe that the educational program in any school district should be designed to help  every student realize and experience his or her maximum in mental, emotional, and  physical growth.  I also believe that ALL STUDENTS CAN LEARN WELL AND SUCCEED IN  SCHOOL when instruction is delivered in an intentional, systematic, and sensitive  manner. The school program should be designed to afford every student an opportunity  for success in both academics and extra-curricular activities. The program should be  varied and it should recognize the different needs, interests, and aptitudes of students.  The school program should utilize technology in several creative ways.  I further believe that the superintendent of a school district MUST be a \"\"TEAM\"\" LEADER  working closely with the school board, faculty, and staff. The superintendent must be an  instructional leader as well as a skilled fiscal manager. He or she must work diligently  to keep all individuals well informed on all of the functions within the school district.  The superintendent MUST be well informed on current educational trends and issues  including the legislative process. Above all the superintendent of schools must have the  ability to deal with people effectively and be able to make meaningful decisions under all  circumstances. The superintendent must be a role model in reference to honesty and  integrity.  I BELIEVE EFFECTIVE SCHOOLS HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS:  HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS  COLLABORATION  GOAL DRIVEN  SOUND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES  STRONG DISCIPLINE  SENSE OF MISSION  DATA DRIVEN  INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERSHIP  ...  Therefore, I believe it is imperative that a superintendent be DATA DRIVEN. His or her  administration must utilize and respond to data rather than to \"\"feelings\"\" or \"\"emotions.\"\"  My philosophy of education is soundly based, but flexible enough to change and adapt to  future needs of students and communities.

And youll want a  powerfully effective and attractive resume because:  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn average, most recruiters spend about 30 seconds scanning a resume and cover  letter before sending it to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    Top Ten Skills companies are looking for in you:  1. Co-op/internship experience  2. Confident communication skills (both written and oral)  3. Strong Grade Point Average  4. Teamwork and interpersonal skills  5. Leadership experience  6. Computer & Technical skills  7. Problem solving/Analytical skills  8. Accomplishments/Achievements  9. Flexibility/adaptability  10. Personal confidence    \\xef\\x82\\xa7    Your resume should provide  EVIDENCE that you possess  many of these skills    \\xef\\x82\\xa7    Your resume should be  TAILORED to match the job  posting as closely as possible  when applying for specific jobs    \\xef\\x82\\xa7    A 1st or 2nd year resume will look  DIFFERENT than a 3rd or 4th  year resume.    \\xef\\x82\\xa7    In 30 seconds, your cover letter and resume package needs to convey an image of who you are, what  youre capable of, and how youve used your abilities to achieve specific results.    \\xef\\x82\\xa7    You want your marketing documents to indicate that you know yourself well and have a firm grasp on  what you bring to the table.    \\xef\\x82\\xa7    This self realization and evaluation time will serve you in other ways as you search for your dream job,  as it will enlighten you to what you like to do, what youre good at, and what kind of a career you  desire.    \\xef\\x82\\xa7    Your resume must reflect these things and youll then be able to speak fluently and confidently in  writing (the resume) and verbally (the interview) about your background and skills in a way that will  impress your potential employer and greatly raise your chance to work where, when, and how you  want.    There are no hard and fast rules to writing and presenting a cover letter and resume, although there are  expected good practices that can guide you as you create your self-promoting, self-marketing documents  as the first step in achieving the job opportunity on the path of the career of your dreams.    When producing your resume, focus on one important objective: to efficiently and effectively  communicate your qualifications to your audience (always, always keep your intended audience in mind!)  To do that, adhere to the 3 Cs: clean, clear, concise.  Clean: You want to make a strong visual impact on your reader before the first word is read:  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Organized layout  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Effective use of white space  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Symmetry  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Uniformity  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Highlighted sections  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Consistent type face such as Arial, size 11 (no bigger than 12, no smaller than 10)  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Professional quality and weight stationary in a neutral color  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 High quality printing  no photocopies  Clear: You want to write who you are in terms of education and experience, what you can do, in terms of  action, and how well you can do it, in terms of accomplishments and achievements:  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Use action phrases beginning with action verbs (see following list)  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Detailed description of duties  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Meaningful accomplishments  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Ask yourself the following questions to stimulate your description of what youve accomplished:  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you identify and/or solve any major issues or problems?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you establish any new or innovative systems or procedures?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you design, test, analyze, and/or implement a process or procedure?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you design, test, analyze, fabricate, repair, maintain a product or manufacturing process?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you develop a product or process or procedure that will raise production?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you develop a product or process or procedure that will lower costs?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Were you a successful team member and/or team leader?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you serve as project manager, coordinator, liaison, representative, or committee chair?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you supervise or train other team members or employees?  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Did you show initiative and go above and beyond what was asked of you - go out of your way  to provide exceptional service to a client, customer, stakeholder?  Concise: You want to state your experience in terms of accomplishments/skills/professional behaviors,  based on your target job, in the shortest, but most understandable way:  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Again, use powerful action phrases beginning with action verbs  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Use bullet points  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Be specific  use hard evidence detail  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Avoid whole sentences  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Use an active voice and past tense for previous experience  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Write in the first person, but without the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 You want to say, in as few carefully chosen words as possible, what action was taken, in what  setting, with what skills, and with what results. So, consider the following format for describing  project experience:  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Project Title  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Objective  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Problem Solving Methods Used (remember action verbs here and give at least 5)  \\xef\\x82\\xa7 Results (or projected results if project is on-going)  The following pages provide a basic template and numerous examples of excellent and effective resumes  of students just like you.

That \\xe2\\x80\\x9coh so critical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  first impression is made by the letter that introduces the resume  the cover letter. So, a cover letter can  be just as important and as powerful as your resume. When the envelope is opened, your cover letter is  the first thing seen. It can make an indelible first impression, it can set the tone for your candidacy, and it  can earn your resume the careful examination it deserves. A good cover letter sets the stage for the  reader to accept your resume as something worth serious attention.  Your first step is to grab your readers attention. You do this with the appearance of your letter: the type  is large and legible enough for others to read, it is completely free of misspellings, and it is well laid out so  that it is easy on the eye, and if that letter is going by mail, rather an e-mail, you grab attention by using  quality stationary, including envelopes.  Your second step is to generate interest with the letters content. The first opportunity you have to do this  is by addressing the letter to someone by name. The cover letter offers you an opportunity to personalize  and target your resume to a particular reader. This is critical, since resumes are impersonal. Without a  personalized cover letter, a resume may create the impression that the addressee is simply part of a  mass mailing. Find out who will be the first in line to evaluate your application materials or better yet,  write to the stakeholder in this hiring process  the person who is responsible for hiring the right person  for the job or who will have the final say as to who is hired. This may take some investigation and  research work, but it is well worth your while.  Important guidelines for writing powerfully effective letters are to have something of interest to  communicate to the reader and to deliver that message with passion and enthusiasm.  Again, know your skills! With a targeted letter, the first step is to indentify your skills and marketable  attributes. Then write with the reader in mind. Show them something you have to offer that will benefit  them. Think of your letter in terms of your readers interest. Put yourself in the employers shoes. You  will get the interview or advance to the next step if you meet the prospective companys \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccriteria or needs  for hire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Address the companys needs as you understand them and draw the connection between those  needs and your skills as a means to meet them. This means more research and investigation on your  end, but, again, well worth your while. Your letter must address and answer the following questions:  \\xef\\x82\\xa7  \\xef\\x82\\xa7  \\xef\\x82\\xa7  \\xef\\x82\\xa7  \\xef\\x82\\xa7  \\xef\\x82\\xa7    What is the company really looking for?  What qualifications do I have that are valuable to a potential employer?  What specific contributions have I made in the past that will excite the employer and tell them that  I am capable of that kind of contribution again?  What type of personality do I have, and am I a team player?  Why do I want to work for this company?  Why would this company want to hire me instead of the guy behind me?    The following pages provide a basic template and numerous examples of excellent and effective resumes  of students just like you. None of these resources are proprietary, so feel free to use any formatting  and/or text you wish.

This position came to my  attention through Mike Smith, a previous supervisor and the GIS Analyst / Lecturer in Michigan  Technological Universitys (MTU) School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science (SFRES). I am  currently finishing up my senior year as an Applied Ecology and Environmental Science major at MTU.  The following list highlights my skills that I believe will allow me to make an immediate and valuable  contribution to the International Conservation Service:            GIS/Remote Sensing Experience  I have completed both an Intro to GIS course and a masters  level GIS course in addition to an Independent Study in GIS/Remote Sensing. I have worked on  several GIS projects including ortho-rectifying aerial photos from the 1940s for GLKN in addition  to being the GIS analyst on my Integrated Resource Assessment (Senior Design/Capstone) team.  Stand Survey Design - Accustomed to obtaining a list of stands that need surveys and creating  the protocol and procedure myself. In addition, I am familiar with many different survey strategies  and methods.  Communication and Interpersonal Skills  I am currently a Teaching Assistant for Introduction  to GIS for Natural Resource Management and have previously been a tour guide for the Michigan  Tech Admissions Department.    My interest in GIS/remote sensing stems from my coursework at MTU, where I developed an appreciation  for the necessity of accurate GIS/remote sensing analysis in the greater natural resources fields. I  especially came to this conclusion when I was attempting to integrate my two primary interests of  wetlands and fire caused disturbance. At some point in the future, I would like to pursue a graduate  degree looking at the interactions between wetlands and fire. As such, I believe that strengthening my  understanding of GIS/remote sensing, not only in my areas of interest but also in natural resources as a  whole, will greatly aid me in my future research.  I have attached my resume for your perusal and ask for the opportunity to interview with you at your  earliest convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.

{"id": 484, "text": "\"Resumes & Cover Letters  for Architectural Designers    Marketing Your Work    A resume is your first opportunity to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csell\\xe2\\x80\\x9d your work and  experience to an architecture or design firm. Most summer  internships and intern architect positions will require a  resume and cover letter, as well as work sample pages. Your  resume should highlight the key projects and experiences  that best represent the skills you will need for the desired  position.    Include your experience with computer hardware and  software applications such as AutoCAD, Adobe  software, Microsoft and others. You can include your  background in sustainable design, green building,  museum, art history and graphic arts.  z    Basic Resume Content  Avoid making your resume too complicated or lengthy; it  should be easy to read and show off the style of your work.  Headings for Resume Sections:  z Personal Contact Information  List your name, address, phone number, and email.  Your email address should be professional and  include your name. You may also include your personal  Web site, if it professionally showcases your work.  z    z    z    Education  Begin with the most recent degree you are pursuing  or have earned. Include the institution, degree you  will earn, your major(s) and minor(s), month and year  of completion, and location with city and state. List  additional degrees in reverse chronological order.  Additional educational experiences may also be listed  in this section, including study abroad and other  academic programs.  Professional Experience  List any professional experience relating to your field,  such as summer internships at architecture or  construction firms. Discuss the kinds of projects  youve worked on, such as education or healthcare.  List presentations you gave or contributed to,  client meetings you attended as an intern, or the  specifics on your work in a design library.  Skills  Within your resume, create a detailed skills section.  Brainstorm and add skills such as design, hand  sketching, rendering, schematics and model building.  Be sure to highlight your soft skills like customer  service, communication, and teambuilding.  Construction and carpentry skills are often a plus.    Awards & Honors  You can also create an Awards & Honors section that  could include awards/prizes from design competitions,  GPA, and on-campus leadership activities and positions.  Depending on your level of experience, you could list  studio projects in a separate Selected Accomplishments  section to add to the information you are presenting.    Crafting a Creative Resume  Consider the overall look of your resume. You may want to  incorporate an artistic element to your resume that showcases your skills as a designer. Your resume can be more  design-oriented than a typical business resume, but should  include the same basic elements.  z    z    z    z    z    z    Use a Sans Serif font such as Arial and be sure to  make it large enough to read easily.  Design your own \"\"letterhead\"\" to showcase your  design skills. You dont need to create your own logo,  but do use your creative abilities to make your  presentation unique.  In some cases, small images of your work can be  used to make your resume stand out.  Your \"\"letterhead\"\" should be used on all of your  marketing materials including your cover letter,  resume, thank you letter, and sample work pages.  Your entire application package may be 4-5 pages;  your letterhead will insure that your name and contact  information is on every page.  In many cases, you may be submitting your application  via email or the Web. When designing your materials,  including sample pages, make sure your files are small  enough to pass through the email file size filter. These  filters are often set at 3 MB (3,000KB), at the most.    Showcasing Your Work  In addition to your resume, you should also create a one or  two-page work sample document to showcase your skills. A  huge benefit of using work sample pages is that they are a  cost-effective way to showcase your work to many employ-    157 Karl Umrath Hall z 204 Lopata Hall z Givens Hall z Phone: 314-935-5930 z Email: careers@wustl.edu z www.careers.wustl.edu    ers. This can include work from studios, internships, travel  experiences, and your own individual artwork. Your sample  pages are a \"\"mini-portfolio\"\" and should also be designed to  match your resume and cover letter.  Portfolios  A portfolio is an additional way to showcase your past experience. The first step in creating your portfolio is to document your work. You should keep photos or copies of work  youve done for studio, classes or summer internships. It is  important that your portfolio give a brief, but consistent  view of your work over time. If you are unsure of what to  include in your portfolio, ask a faculty member for help.  You will most likely create one portfolio to use in interviews  to showcase your work. You may decide to use a professional document portfolio or design your own binding system or  case to display your work. Just make sure the cover is  durable. The inside pages should include samples of your  best work, as well as your resume. Your portfolio should  also include artistic or design elements that reflect your style.    Writing Your Cover Letter    A cover letter is your introduction to a prospective employer.  Your letter should demonstrate your ability to think clearly  and write persuasively. An effective cover letter makes you  stand out as a candidate. In fact, some employers consider it  even more important than your resume.  Your cover letter should create a link between the needs of  the organization and your skills and experience related to  those needs. Demonstrate your motivation, creativity and  knowledge of the organization. Rather than restating what is  on your resume, enhance your qualifications by describing  how your past experience will benefit the employer.  A cover letter should always accompany your resume and  should match the overall design and feel of your resume.    Cover Letter Writing Tips  z    Write a custom cover letter for each position and  print it out on the same paper as your resume.    z    Address your letter to a specific person. If you do  not have a name, call the organization and ask for the  name and title of the person who should receive your  letter. As a last resort, you may use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Hiring  Manager.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    z    In general, cover letters specifically state the position  you are seeking (do this in the first sentence), tell the  reader why you think you should be considered and  suggest the next course of action (e.g., you will follow  up with a phone call).    z    Research the organization, study the position  description, and tailor your letter accordingly.  Your initiative and knowledge will make your letter  stand out from others. Resist the temptation to use a  standard letter that only changes the company name.    z    Focus on the readers needs, not yours. Make your  qualifications clear and emphasize how you can help  the organization.    z    Limit the letter to one page. Business writing is  different from academic writing. Keep it simple,  straight-forward and to the point.    z    Make the most of referrals and connections.  Name the person who referred you in the opening  sentence. The familiar name will grab the readers  attention.    z    Cover letters serve as a method to help employers  evaluate your writing ability. Spelling and  grammar must be perfect. Ask friends, mentors and  advisors to review your letter and provide feedback.    Cover Letter Format  Opening Paragraph: In the first sentence, state why you  are writing and/or the position or type of work for which  you are applying. State how you heard of the opening or  organization. The last line should give a brief synopsis of  who you are and what you can contribute to the organization  or position. A good way to do this is to indicate the top two  or three skills that make you a great fit for the position. The  first paragraph should be three to four sentences.  Middle Paragraph(s): Explain why you are interested in  working for the employer by demonstrating your knowledge  of the organization, and tell the employer how you will perform in your desired position based on concrete references  to your previous accomplishments. Enhance your resume by  connecting the dots between what the employer wants and  how your past experience will enable you to fill his/her  needs. When appropriate, talk about the results of your past  responsibilities. Write with concise, confident statements.  If this paragraph starts to get long, split it into two short  paragraphs to make them easier to absorb.  Closing Paragraph: Indicate that you would like to talk  with the employer in person to further discuss the opportunity. Give your phone number and email address in case  they would like to contact you for further information. State  your planned next steps, such as calling to ensure that your  application materials have been received. Close by thanking  the person for his/her time and consideration.

Thread on  textile is my medium, much as \"\"oil on canvas\"\" or \"\"acrylic on hard board\"\" is a painter\\'s medium. The medium of my work  can be further defined by the ground used: commercial textile, hand dyed textile or rust pigmented textile. The thread is  applied to these grounds using a small needle in a time-intensive process.

RESEARCH IN PROGRESS  Computing  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComputer-Assisted Visual Inspection (of Chinese Paintings)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In conjunction with  Brown Scholarly Technology Group, development of procedures and standards for visual  analysis of pre-modern Chinese paintings. Three goals: advanced scholarly research  tools, pedagogical applications (graduate and undergraduate), documentation and  publication. The scholarly demonstration project is: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaking the Chinese Cultural  Heritage at the Courts of the Northern Song,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which works attributed to periods  ranging from the 5th to the 10th centuries are subjected to manipulations of scale and  orientation, and isolation of form-types, stroke types and self-documentation, through  uniform actions that are controlled carefully to maximize visual truthfulness, and are  shown to be contemporary products, probably made during the 12th century.  Documentation in progress. Fieldwork: Beijing 2005. This project was the focus of my  2005-06 Leave and continues as my primary research mode during my 2009-2010 leave.  Supported by Clark Art Institute Fellowship and Brown Presidents Venture Fund,  Wendy J. Strothman Faculty Research Award, STG Faculty Research Grant, Humanities  Research Fund.  Books  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMAKING THE CHINESE CULTURAL HERITAGE AT THE COURTS OF THE  SONG DYNASTY (960-1279)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This project began as the scholarly component of my  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComputer-Assisted Visual Inspection (of Chinese Painting)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d project (see immediately  above, where work to date and funding sources are cited). I have developed it through  read conference papers and articles in progress, and now am preparing to further develop  my research into a book. In my work to date I have used visual argumentation and  textual evidence to demonstrate my proposition that the paintings that populate the  traditional and modern history of the early great painters of China actually are 12thcentury creations that were commissioned by the Song Dynasty emperors in order to  create an continuous material history of the Chinese cultural heritage. Through  Sinological research I have proposed means of transmission and production of such  images at the Song court. Currently I am preparing articles for specialist and general  scholarly publications (see below). In the next book  phase of my project, I focus on  these anonymous 12th-century place-holders for lost early paintings  repositioning them  in their original context as Song-Dynasty engagements with Chinas visual past, tracing  their subsequent transmission and influence in later Imperial China, and the  consequences for the history of Chinese painting as it is understood today.

{"id": 587, "text": "\"PERFORMING ARTS RESUME  Content  A performers resume details your experience in a performing arts discipline, your abilities  as a performer, and your physical characteristics. In a professional resume, it is considered  inappropriate to include personal information, but in your performers resume, you will  have to include personal information. Often, employers will want t know your height,  weight, hair color and build. Sometimes, theyll even want your measurements, for costume  purposes.  Format  Unlike professional resumes, performers resumes are often broken into columns and kept  to a page a length. Traditionally, performers resumes can include sections on  education/training, union membership, performing experience, related work experience,  awards/distinctions, and special skills. Professional resumes tend to have short paragraph  sections. Performers resumes are usually divided into concise list form.    Resume Guidelines for Multitalented People  If you have focused on more than one discipline, get specific! Dont try to cram all of your  theater, dance, and singing experience into the same document. You will not be able to do  justice to your experience or your resume. If you have enough experience in more than one  discipline to warrant more than one resume, then write more than one resume, and only  submit the resume pertinent to the job title.  If you are an actor and a singer, a choreographer and a dancer, a composer and a director,  have a separate resume for each title. Keep each one very focused. If you decide to include  a section like Other or Special Skills, you can mention your other talent in a single phrase;  for example, Extensive theater background or Proficient in Alexander Technique. It may  feel as though you are minimizing your other areas of expertise, but what youre really  doing is focusing. Do not underestimate your special skills when submitting a resume. A  director or organization may be looking for something rare and atypical during an audition  scenario, and those special skills may give you an edge.  Your resume is suppose to convince an employer that they want to hire you, and that you  are perfect for the job theyre offering. That means you have to keep everything in the  document relevant. If youre auditioning for a musical, youll need to highlight a variety of  abilities; if youre auditioning for a Hollywood comedy, it might be unwise to highlight  your career in modern dance.  If you have developed a unique performers art genre that incorporates aspects of more than  one discipline, and the job you are seeking requires this ability, then you should develop  your resume accordingly. You should still keep it to one page. Remember, choose  representative highlights of your training and experience. You dont need to include  everything. Be discerning. Choose your most impressive accomplishments, and in this case,  choose a sample representative of your range.    Performers Resume Options  Effective and Appropriate Photo Options From Headshots to Galleries  In addition to providing your stats and measurements within your resume, youll probably  want to include a photograph. Accompanying your resume, a good photograph can help  convey the intangible qualities about you that make you a good performer. During a large  audition, putting a name to a face is important, and not including a photograph could lessen  the chances of getting the part. Performers of all disciplines can use a single headshot, but  sometimes more is appropriate. For instance, a dancer may want to include a full body  action shot to highlight a particular strength (for instance, jumps or turns). An actor may  include a photo featuring him/herself in costume in a particular role. This approach can  highlight a physical and technical versatility. Whatever you choose, be sure your face is  clearly defined, and easy to recognize. Be careful your visuals to not detract from your  resume, including a single headshot on the same page as your text is appropriate. Anything  else should be kept separate. These separate documents are your gallery. You may not want  to include your gallery with every copy of your resume that you send out. It is more  appropriate to offer a gallery to an employer who has expressed interest in you, or who has  specifically requested it.  You may be thinking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThats all very well and good, but how am I going to afford this  gallery when I cant even afford head shots?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One option is to work with a photography  student. This arrangement can be a good, even trade. The photographer gains experience  and additions to her portfolio; you gain a valuable service for a nominal fee instead of  astronomical professional costs.  Scannable Resumes  Your chances of being discovered improve greatly when your resume is available online.  Once your resume is scanned, you can upload it into searchable databases. In this situation,  employers may call you if they are interested, which tips the interviewing/auditioning  power-balance in your favor.

It includes examples from those that have attended flight attendant  schools, male and female applicants and while the preferred  resume is kept short and succinct unless absolutely necessary,  youll find 1, 2 and 3 page resumes  and while some are also less  than perfect they have got their owners a job with an airline.  And while all the information enclosed is personal and true, all  identifiers such as phone numbers, addresses and airlines have  been removed due confidentiality agreements that all airline  employees including Flight Attendants have to sign prior to  commencing training.  I must reiterate that its about being prepared and good  preparation is by far the best way to compile a resume that sells  you in a way that gets you an interview with an Airline.    And its always good to  have a comparison or  bench mark so that you  can see what has  worked and how you  can perhaps copy,  change, add, delete or  improve your resume  from the examples that  you will see in this  publication following the  guidelines provided in  my Flight Attendant  Interviews Made Easy  manual.    NOTE: My request when asking for resume examples was to remove identifiers and try to keep  format and content that the givers would be happy for others to see. Youll notice that all resumes  are different and some have just the identifiers removed, some have identifiers replaced and others  have all content removed with just format remaining.    Again, I wanted to show you \\xe2\\x80\\x98REAL flight attendant resumes without \\xe2\\x80\\x98work shopping them before I  included them here so they are pretty much as I received them and I think collectively they will  definitely show you things that you will want to copy, change, add, delete or improve with your  own resume.    I also dont wish to critique the resumes included as that is not what this publication is about but  rather invite you to refer back to my manual for the tips, hints, recommendations and presentation  standards that I recommend for your resume to ensure that you make your resume the best it can  be.

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a  great place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of  skills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more  specific to your major, intended industry, or job function.  A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action  verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified  through the accomplishment statement.    IV.

Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements  under each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently  graduated with a bachelors degree, those who are staying within the same career field,  and candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred  by employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and  clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories.

Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight  transferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and  employers.    VI.

Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics  The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,  and skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,  think of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect  candidate for the opportunity at hand.  Resume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best  practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content  and a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with  regard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify  the skills you possess and employers are seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should  keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing  elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the readers eye to rest.  Using .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A  10-12 point font size is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold  a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,  dates, etc. line up neatly on the page.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully  read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least  2-3 people proofread it as well.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when  you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,  quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry  or job function-specific) and transferable skills.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the  skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily  scan your resume for what he or she is seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is  assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy duties included...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy responsibilities  were\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.  Also, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your  most important information stands out.    3    II. Key Elements of a Successful Resume  Your First and Last Name  \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Phone number \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Email address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Street address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 City, state & zip code \\xe2\\x99\\xa6  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  OBJECTIVE  Create a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area  you are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be  omitted or substituted with a \\xe2\\x80\\x95Career Highlights\\xe2\\x80\\x96 or \\xe2\\x80\\x95Summary of Qualifications\\xe2\\x80\\x96 section.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  EDUCATION  Institution City, State  (Expected) Graduation Month Year  Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations  GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)  Other possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  EXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year  The position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of  the Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.  You can bold or italicize your title or your organization\\xe2\\x80\\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.  In this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the  skills employers are seeking.  Start with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when  possible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or  more skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.  Consider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?  What were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does  this experience relate to your internship/employment goal?  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year  Bulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.  Be specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.  Make sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or  making it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year  Using multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant  experience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.  Positions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.  In an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are  applying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.  Emphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.  Organization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter)  City, State Month Year - Month Year  This section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,  professional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \\xe2\\x80\\x95job title\\xe2\\x80\\x96 with the role you played.  Including bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  ADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and  interpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.]  Technology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For  example: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop.  Languages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish.    4    III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs  TRANSFERABLE SKILLS  Transferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those  that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your  bulleted accomplishment statements.
