William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2006-2007)  Summary of Research and Scholarship:  I am a sociologist of higher education. Through research, writing, and teaching, I have contributed to our  understanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher  education. My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas\\xe2\\x80\\x94what facilitates it and  what impedes it within different types of colleges and universities\\xe2\\x80\\x94and identifies implications for academic  leaders who manage organizational change, knowledge change and professional socialization. Using theories  and methods from sociology, I analyze how organizational, intellectual, political, economic, and professional  interests redefine the content, structure, conduct, and relative legitimacy of academic fields.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Key studies include: the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields; dynamics of  professional socialization across disciplines; tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective  investment; the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education (1975-2000), a pivotal era of  changing societal expectations; forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration.  Serving in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry in  graduate education, leadership development, academic collaboration, and organizational change.  2    PUBLICATIONS  Books  Gumport, P.

Current Research:  American Government: Democracy in Transition (Pearson, under contract)  This book examines the American political system and its institutions as we transform from a  democracy of self-interest to one of increasing transparency and evidence-based decision  making. The book is designed for introductory American Government courses, and therefore  covers, in depth, the framers, constitutional theory, institutions, and participation  while  simultaneously engaging with a student population who may be only vaguely interested in  government.  Linking Science to Decision Making in Environmental Policy: Bridging the Disciplinary Gap (coauthored with Lawrence Becker, The MIT Press, under contract)  This book examines the role of science in moderating interest-based politics in resource  management and environmental stewardship. The manuscript builds a model of science based  policy processes where management decisions are based on stakeholder input but constrained  by scientific efficacy. Ultimately, the project is intended to develop a protocol to maximize crossdisciplinary decision making in environmental policy.  Environmental Deceptions: The Tension between Liberalism and Environmental Policymaking in  the United States (with Kristy Michaud; Albany: State University of New York Press, 2nd edition  under contract)  This book brings together normative analyses and empirical data to explain the structural  limitations liberal society places on environmental improvement. I argue that cultural  ambivalence toward communitarian ethics has made the traditional environmental  infrastructure problematic. The book exposes the subtle tensions that often lead to policy  failure, and suggests that traditional policy models are insufficient to resolve existing  environmental dilemmas in air, water, waste, and energy.

Also much time was required to port ABB  applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on  single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux  while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch. This was a research  project that studied the properties of preempt_rt patched Linux in real world scenarios and  decided on worst case timings that will satisfy requirements in ABBs robotic applications    Project  Name  Role  Client  Duration  Work Location  Description    Description  CCPU  Software Developer  NOATM  July 2009  Bangalore  This project involved putting realtime embedded Linux on the MPC5200 based CCPU board.

Such porting does not provide any value  addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.

Jensen Project Justification    Page 2 of 2    Looking at Bradleys achievements, its hard to believe his phone wasnt ringing off the  hook. But his original r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9 was a five-page data dump that made the reader really  work to figure how what hed done.  Part of his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was that he was good at just about every aspect of senior  management, so defining a brand and honing in on the most relevant achievements was  a challenge. I embraced his multiple talents as assets and positioned him a leader who  delivers bottom-line growth by improving every aspect of business from Sales to  Operations to HR. I built a branding statement and brief introductory profile to set the  expectations of the reader accordingly.    Rather than trying to include all of his accomplishments, I honed in on representative  projects from each of his areas of strength, creating mini case studies that provide insight  into Bradleys management style and proof of his effectiveness. One of his  accomplishments, saving $30M per year in delivery model operations, became a simple  graph that tells an immediate story to the reader.  I wanted to take advantage of Bradleys stellar early career performance as an executive  at a major bank without risking age discrimination. So I created an Early Career  Summary without dates.  Bradleys new resume generated a lot of interest.
