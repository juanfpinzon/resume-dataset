As a designer she is very detail-oriented and she  can provide constructive and valuable feedback on visual design as well, which is a real plus in our industry.  Dawa can produce very accurate wireframes, white board exercises and give advice on the final output. Her  strengths are definitely precision, attention to details, passion for the product and managerial skills.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Fabio Benedetti, worked directly with Dawa at Alfresco  \"\"Dawa was a member of our sprint team and she made invaluable contributions to the UX design of our  current and future android products. She understands the requirements and bought unique views that can be  implemented.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Surendra Devarashetty, worked directly with Dawa at Intel Corporation  \"\"Dawa was a great addition to our Ux team. She could always be counted on to bring a fresh perspective  to our projects and follow through with reliability. Dawa\\'s experience and talents made her a natural fit for  mobile Ux design. She will be missed.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jim Granger, managed Dawa at Intel Corporation  \"\"I had the esteemed privilege to work with Dawa on a complicated workflow web app for our company  CrossCurrent. Being a primary developer on the project it was an absolute dream to have a designer as  thoughtful, talented and easy to work with as Dawa. The design principles she came up with were thorough  and her wireframes were impeccably presented. What I appreciated about Dawa was that she was very  approachable and some of my best and easiest work was developing side by side with her giving tips and    Page7    recommendations as I went. I believe that the strength of our product was much improved by her work, and  would gladly recommend her to anyone seeking a highly qualified, professional UI/UX designer.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jesse Stromwick, worked directly with Dawa at CrossCurrent, Inc.  \"\"Dawa is a highly competent user experience designer with strong expertise in mobile and responsive design.  She brought valuable insight to the SapientNitro UX team at Vodafone UK where she worked on the mobile  \\'Help & Support\\' section of the website. Her attention to detail together with her technical understanding  helped to deliver a useful, usable and well-considered solution. I recommend her without hesitation!\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Dominic Winsor, managed Dawa indirectly at Vodafone - Sapient Nitro  \"\"Dawa and I worked together on a web user survey study for MTV\\'s video on demand service. Dawa was  responsible for designing the survey, collecting the data, carrying out statistical analysis on the user data  and creating detailed finding reports. Furthermore, she expertly led an in-lab usability study on the client\\'s  prototype, and a diary study/focus group with the target audience. Dawa provided the client with phenomenal  insights and displayed excellent presentation skills in her delivery of her findings to MTV and was an asset to  the team and I would not hesitate to work with her again.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cam Bennett, worked directly with Dawa at Cimex Media Ltd  \"\"I worked alongside Dawa at Skype. She was the UX resource on the re-design for Skype.com (Skype\\'s  consumer facing website). Dawa contributed intelligent UX solutions and delivered high fidelity wireframes  of her ideas.

I  look forward to working with her again in the future and would recommend her in a heartbeat.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Alex Rekasi, worked directly with Dawa at Skype  \"\"I had a great experience managing Dawa during the length of her contract at Adobe. Her ramp up time was  minimal and her impact immediate. She provided us with smart design that met both user needs and was  implementable within our schedule. If you are looking for a competent designer who knows their craft and  can deliver - you\\'ll be well served speaking with Dawa.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Dan Cooney, was Dawa\\'s client  \"\"Dawa was a real joy to work, both as a Sr Information Architect and Interaction Architect on a large number  of complex engagements. She brought deep and broad senior-level UX skillsets to each project, as well as an  intimate knowledge as to the technical feasibility of what was being designed due to her hardcore background  as a developer, too. We worked together on projects that spanned extremely creative/edgy/marketing-focused  to complex, interaction-based web-based apps for the general public (the largest credit card company in the  world). She was pivotal in spear-heading a complete re-design of an extremely complex, internal-facing, webbased app for insurance and annuities groups of a Fortune 100 client, including extensive field user research  Page8    of financial advisers/brokers as insights into the new user-centric design that we proposed and built. I would  welcome the opportunity to work with Dawa on any type of project in the future and hope that our paths cross  again.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Steve Haak, managed Dawa at Avenue A Razorfish  \"\"I was working with Dawa on a six month project for Prudential Retirement to design the user experience  strategy for a splan administrator website. Dawa picked up on the financial information for retirement plans  right away, and took a leading role in designing the interactions and data displays for one of the major site  sections. Dawa completed most of her work independently without the need for much guidance. She could  always be relied on to have her work completed on time, and with the extra thought put in to deliver more  than what was asked for. Dawa\\'s work was well received all around, and I can only recommend her for any  future projects.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Martin Kas, managed Dawa at Avenue A Razorfish  \"\"My first impression of Dawa was of our portfolio review when she came in to interview. With no trace of  hesitation, she showed both her finished work alongside several hand-drawn wireframes and prints which she  had annotated by hand. I could quickly tell that she would be able to create a finished product, but was also  able to cogently discuss her thoughts using whatever medium was around. In other words, she is a designer  who can quickly make her point.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Erik Gibb, managed Dawa indirectly at Modem Media/Digitas Inc./Publicis  \"\"Dawa was the UI/UX lead developer and designer at SDO. As such, she pioneered CMS software for  WNYC and other major clients built on open source technology, creating first of its kind software interfaces  as well as compelling web user experiences. In addition, she was the news anchor at Talk Tech: an  innovative, syndicated radio program where her passion and knowledge for technology showed through  and gave communities access to knowledge of emerging technologies. I recommend her highly to any team  requiring highly developed skills in both the technical and creative arenas, and in need of an individual with  the passion and drive to make it happen.\"\"  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Colleen Nagle, managed Dawa at SDO.Net and TalkTech  Contact Dawa on LinkedIn    Page9\"", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1, 11, "Name"], [13, 28, "Designation"], [111, 145, "Degree"], [149, 169, "College Name"], [181, 201, "Years of Experience"], [246, 264, "Companies worked at"], [269, 288, "Companies worked at"], [298, 304, "Location"], [306, 314, "Location"], [319, 332, "Location"], [390, 396, "Companies worked at"], [399, 408, "Companies worked at"], [410, 415, "Companies worked at"], [417, 422, "Companies worked at"], [424, 432, "Companies worked at"], [437, 442, "Companies worked at"], [1043, 1058, "Designation"], [1062, 1071, "Companies worked at"], [1072, 1101, "Years of Experience"], [1121, 1135, "Designation"], [1275, 1289, "Designation"], [1443, 1456, "Designation"], [1460, 1481, "Companies worked at"], [1485, 1503, "Companies worked at"], [1505, 1534, "Years of Experience"], [1620, 1628, "Companies worked at"], [2234, 2252, "Designation"], [2256, 2262, "Companies worked at"], [2273, 2300, "Years of Experience"], [2686, 2702, "Designation"], [2706, 2714, "Companies worked at"], [2716, 2740, "Years of Experience"], [3404, 3422, "Designation"], [3426, 3443, "Companies worked at"], [3445, 3470, "Years of Experience"], [3669, 3693, "Designation"], [3697, 3706, "Companies worked at"], [3708, 3731, "Years of Experience"], [4055, 4059, "Companies worked at"], [4061, 4070, "Companies worked at"], [4072, 4080, "Companies worked at"], [4085, 4106, "Companies worked at"], [4109, 4136, "Designation"], [4140, 4158, "Companies worked at"], [4160, 4189, "Years of Experience"], [4252, 4260, "Location"], [4707, 4729, "Designation"], [4733, 4737, "Companies worked at"], [4739, 4761, "Years of Experience"], [4853, 4855, "Location"], [5310, 5314, "Companies worked at"], [5317, 5333, "Designation"], [5336, 5344, "Companies worked at"], [5347, 5360, "Companies worked at"], [5362, 5387, "Years of Experience"], [5459, 5461, "Location"], [5476, 5484, "Companies worked at"], [5638, 5663, "Designation"], [5667, 5682, "Companies worked at"], [5684, 5714, "Years of Experience"], [6208, 6232, "Designation"], [6236, 6246, "Companies worked at"], [6248, 6273, "Years of Experience"], [6721, 6745, "Designation"], [6749, 6754, "Companies worked at"], [6756, 6781, "Years of Experience"], [7069, 7084, "Designation"], [7088, 7097, "Companies worked at"], [7099, 7129, "Years of Experience"], [7546, 7569, "Designation"], [7573, 7578, "Companies worked at"], [7580, 7604, "Years of Experience"], [8081, 8106, "Designation"], [8110, 8119, "Companies worked at"], [8121, 8132, "Years of Experience"], [8594, 8615, "Designation"], [8619, 8637, "Companies worked at"], [8639, 8650, "Years of Experience"], [9263, 9284, "Designation"], [9288, 9312, "Companies worked at"], [9332, 9343, "Years of Experience"], [9685, 9706, "Designation"], [9710, 9718, "Companies worked at"], [9720, 9731, "Years of Experience"], [10201, 10221, "Designation"], [10225, 10236, "Companies worked at"], [10238, 10249, "Years of Experience"], [10620, 10651, "Designation"], [10655, 10659, "Companies worked at"], [10661, 10672, "Years of Experience"], [10806, 10828, "Designation"], [10832, 10839, "Companies worked at"], [10844, 10852, "Companies worked at"], [10854, 10865, "Years of Experience"], [11817, 11837, "College Name"], [11839, 11871, "Degree"], [11899, 11909, "Degree"], [11922, 11932, "Name"], [11934, 11949, "Designation"], [11971, 11989, "Email Address"], [1103, 1118, "Years of Experience"], [1536, 1544, "Years of Experience"], [2302, 2310, "Years of Experience"], [2677, 2683, "Companies worked at"], [2741, 2750, "Years of Experience"], [3472, 3480, "Years of Experience"], [3733, 3741, "Years of Experience"], [3744, 3753, "Job Specific Skills"], [4190, 4199, "Years of Experience"], [4202, 4211, "Job Specific Skills"], [4602, 4628, "Tech Tools"], [4651, 4664, "Job Specific Skills"], [4763, 4771, "Years of Experience"], [5389, 5397, "Years of Experience"], [5716, 5724, "Years of Experience"], [6275, 6283, "Years of Experience"], [6783, 6791, "Years of Experience"], [6808, 6826, "Job Specific Skills"], [6831, 6833, "Job Specific Skills"], [7131, 7139, "Years of Experience"], [7234, 7251, "Job Specific Skills"], [7253, 7261, "Job Specific Skills"], [7263, 7276, "Job Specific Skills"], [7606, 7614, "Years of Experience"], [8134, 8150, "Years of Experience"], [8652, 8659, "Years of Experience"]]}

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a  great place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of  skills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more  specific to your major, intended industry, or job function.  A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action  verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified  through the accomplishment statement.    IV.

Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements  under each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently  graduated with a bachelors degree, those who are staying within the same career field,  and candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred  by employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and  clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories.    V.    Functional & Combination Resume Samples...\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6..Pages 12-13  This format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently,  have gaps in their employment history, or are hoping to transition to a new industry  or unrelated job function. Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight  transferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and  employers.    VI.

Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics  The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,  and skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,  think of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect  candidate for the opportunity at hand.  Resume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best  practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content  and a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with  regard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify  the skills you possess and employers are seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should  keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing  elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the readers eye to rest.  Using .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A  10-12 point font size is recommended.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold  a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,  dates, etc. line up neatly on the page.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully  read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least  2-3 people proofread it as well.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when  you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,  quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry  or job function-specific) and transferable skills.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the  skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily  scan your resume for what he or she is seeking.  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is  assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy duties included...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy responsibilities  were\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xef\\x81\\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.  Also, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your  most important information stands out.    3    II. Key Elements of a Successful Resume  Your First and Last Name  \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Phone number \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Email address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 Street address \\xe2\\x99\\xa6 City, state & zip code \\xe2\\x99\\xa6  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  OBJECTIVE  Create a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area  you are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be  omitted or substituted with a \\xe2\\x80\\x95Career Highlights\\xe2\\x80\\x96 or \\xe2\\x80\\x95Summary of Qualifications\\xe2\\x80\\x96 section.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  EDUCATION  Institution City, State  (Expected) Graduation Month Year  Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations  GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)  Other possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  TECHNICAL SKILLS   Utilities   Languages   Software   Databases   Hardware  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  EXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   The position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of  the Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.   You can bold or italicize your title or your organization\\xe2\\x80\\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.   In this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the  skills employers are seeking.   Start with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when  possible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or  more skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.   Consider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?  What were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does  this experience relate to your internship/employment goal?  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   Bulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.   Be specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.   Make sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or  making it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]  Organization, Your Job Title  City, State  Month Year - Month Year   Using multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant  experience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.   Positions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.   In an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are  applying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.   Emphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.  Organization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter)  City, State Month Year - Month Year   This section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,  professional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \\xe2\\x80\\x95job title\\xe2\\x80\\x96 with the role you played.    4    III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs  TRANSFERABLE SKILLS  Transferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those  that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your bulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following:  CLERICAL  Bookkeeping  Classifying  Collecting  Compiling  Computing  Examining  Filing  Organizing  Recording  Word processing    PROBLEM SOLVING  Analyzing  Appraising  Diagnosing  Examining  Executing  Planning  Proving  Reasoning  Recognizing  Validating    TECHNICAL  Adjusting  Aligning  Assembling  Drafting  Engineering  Installing  Observing  Operating  Programming  Repairing    CREATIVE  Designing  Developing  Establishing  Illustrating  Imagining  Improvising  Inventing  performing  Revitalizing  Visualizing    RESEARCH  Assessing  Calculating  Collecting  Diagnosing  Evaluating  Examining  Extrapolating  Interviewing  Investigating  Synthesizing    TRAINING  Adapting  Communicating  Demonstrating  Enabling  Encouraging  Evaluating  Explaining  Instructing  Planning  Stimulating    ACTION VERBS  Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a  reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary  the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences. Below is a list of verbs to help get you started.
